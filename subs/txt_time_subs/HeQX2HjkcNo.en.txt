00:00:04 there is a hole at the bottom of math a hole that means we will never know everything with certainty
00:00:11 there will always be true statements that cannot be proven now no one knows what those statements
00:00:17 are exactly but they could be something like the twin prime conjecture
00:00:22 twin primes are prime numbers that are separated by just one number like 11 and 13 or 17 and 19.
00:00:30 and as you go up the number line primes occur less frequently and twin primes are rarer still but the
00:00:35 twin prime conjecture is that there are infinitely many twin primes you never
00:00:42 run out as of right now no one has proven this conjecture true or false
00:00:49 but the crazy thing is this we may never know because what has been proven is that in any system of mathematics
00:00:57 where you can do basic arithmetic there will always be true statements that are
00:01:04 impossible to prove that specifically this is the game of life created in 1970 by mathematician john conway
00:01:16 sadly he passed away in 2020 from covet 19. conway's game of life is played on an infinite grid of square cells
00:01:25 each of which is either live or dead and there are only two rules one any dead cell with exactly three neighbors
00:01:34 comes to life and two any living cell with less than two or more than three neighbors dies
00:01:40 once you've set up the initial arrangement of cells the two rules are applied to create the
00:01:45 next generation and then the one after that and the one after that and so on
00:01:51 it's totally automatic conway called it a zero player game but even though the rules are simple the
00:01:58 game itself can generate a wide variety of behavior some patterns are stable once they arise
00:02:03 they never change others oscillate back and forth in a loop a few can travel across the grid forever
00:02:11 like this glider here but a few keep growing forever they keep generating new cells
00:02:26 now you would think that given the simple rules of the game you could just look at any pattern and determine what
00:02:32 will happen to it will it eventually reach a steady state or will it keep growing without limit
00:02:38 but it turns out this question is impossible to answer the ultimate fate of a pattern in
00:02:45 conway's game of life is undecidable meaning there is no possible algorithm that is guaranteed to answer the
00:02:54 question in a finite amount of time you could always just try running the pattern and see what happens
00:02:58 i mean the rules of the game are a kind of algorithm after all but that's not guaranteed to give you an
00:03:03 answer either because even if you run it for a million generations you won't be able to say
00:03:08 whether it'll last forever or just 2 million generations or a billion or a googleplex
00:03:16 is there something special about the game of life that makes it undecidable nope there are actually
00:03:23 a huge number of systems that are undecidable like wang tiles quantum physics airline ticketing systems
00:03:32 and even magic the gathering to understand how undecidability shows up in all of these places
00:03:40 we have to go back 150 years to a full-blown revolt in 1874 georg cantor a german mathematician
00:03:50 published a paper that launched a new branch of mathematics called set theory a set is just a well-defined collection
00:03:57 of things so the two shoes on your feet are a set as are all the planetariums in the world
00:04:04 there's a set with nothing in it the empty set and a set with everything in it now
00:04:09 cantor was thinking about sets of numbers like natural numbers positive integers like 1
00:04:17 2 3 4 and so on and real numbers which include fractions like a third five halves and also
00:04:22 irrational numbers like pi e and the square root of two basically any number that can be represented as an
00:04:30 infinite decimal he wondered are there more natural numbers or more real numbers between zero and one
00:04:40 the answer might seem obvious there are an infinite number of each so both sets should be the same size but
00:04:46 to check this logic canter imagined writing down an infinite list matching up each natural number on
00:04:51 one side with a real number between zero and one on the other
00:04:56 now since each real number is an infinite decimal there is no first one so we can just write them down
00:05:02 in any random order the key is to make sure we get them all with no duplicates
00:05:08 and line them up one to one with an integer if we can do that with none left over well then we know that the set of
00:05:15 natural numbers and the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 are the same size so assume we've done that
00:05:23 we have a complete infinite list with each integer acting like an index number a unique
00:05:28 identifier for each real number on the list now cantor says start writing down a new real number
00:05:36 and the way we're going to do it is by taking the first digit of the first number and adding one
00:05:42 then take the second digit of the second number and again add one take the third digit of the third number
00:05:47 add one and keep doing this all the way down the list if the digit is a nine just roll it back to an eight
00:05:54 and by the end of this process you'll have a real number between zero and one but here's the thing
00:06:03 this number won't appear anywhere on our list it's different from the first number in the first decimal place different from
00:06:08 the second number in the second decimal place and so on down the line it has to be different from
00:06:14 every number on the list by at least one digit the number on the diagonal that's why this is called cantor's
00:06:22 diagonalization proof it shows there must be more real numbers between 0
00:06:29 and 1 then there are natural numbers extending out to infinity so not all infinities are the same
00:06:37 size cantor call these countable and uncountable infinities respectively and in fact there are many more
00:06:43 uncountable infinities which are even larger now cantor's work was just the latest blow to mathematics for 2000 years
00:06:50 euclid's elements were considered the bedrock of the discipline but at the turn of the 19th century
00:06:56 lobashevsky and gauss discovered non-euclidean geometries and this prompted mathematicians to examine more
00:07:03 closely the foundations of their field and they did not like what they saw the idea of a limit
00:07:09 at the heart of calculus turned out to be poorly defined and now cantor was showing that infinity
00:07:15 itself was much more complex than anyone had imagined in all this upheaval mathematics fractured
00:07:21 and a huge debate broke out among mathematicians at the end of the 1800s on the one side were the intuitionists
00:07:28 who thought that cantor's work was nonsense they were convinced that math was a pure creation of the human mind
00:07:36 and that infinities like cantors weren't real auri puankere said that later generations will regard set theory as a
00:07:43 disease from which one has recovered leopold chronicler called cantor a scientific charlatan
00:07:50 and a corrupter of the youth and he worked to keep cantor from getting a job he wanted
00:07:55 on the other side were the formalists they thought that math could be put on absolutely secure logical foundations
00:08:01 through cantor's set theory the informal leader of the formalists was the german mathematician david hilbert
00:08:08 hilbert was a living legend a hugely influential mathematician who had worked in nearly every area
00:08:14 of mathematics he almost beat einstein to the punch on general relativity he developed entirely new mathematical
00:08:20 concepts that were crucial for quantum mechanics and he knew that cantor's work was brilliant hilbert was convinced that a more formal
00:08:28 and rigorous system of mathematical proof based on set theory could solve all the issues that had
00:08:33 cropped up in math over the last century and most other mathematicians agreed with him
00:08:39 no one shall expel us from the paradise that cantor has created hilbert declared but in 1901 bertrand
00:08:46 russell pointed out a serious problem in cantor's set theory russell knew that if sets can contain anything
00:08:52 they can contain other sets or even themselves for example the set of all sets must contain itself
00:08:59 as does the set of sets with more than five elements in them you could even talk about the set of all
00:09:04 sets that contain themselves but this leads straight to a problem what about
00:09:10 r the set of all sets that don't contain themselves if r doesn't contain itself well then it must contain itself
00:09:19 but if r does contain itself then by definition it must not contain itself so r contains itself if and only if
00:09:27 it doesn't russell had found another paradox of self-reference and he later explained his paradox using
00:09:33 a hairy analogy let's say there's a village populated entirely by
00:09:39 grown men with a strange law against beards specifically the law states that the village barber must shave all
00:09:45 and only those men of the village who do not shave themselves but the barber himself lives in the
00:09:51 village too of course and he's a man so who shaves him if he doesn't shave himself then the
00:09:58 barber has to shave him but the barber can't shave himself because the barber doesn't shave anyone
00:10:03 who shaves themselves so the barber must shave himself if and only if
00:10:09 he doesn't shave himself it's a contradiction the intuitionists rejoiced at russell's paradox thinking it had proven set theory
00:10:18 hopelessly flawed but zermelo and other mathematicians from hilbert school solved the problem by restricting the
00:10:23 concept of a set so the collection of all sets for example is not a set anymore
00:10:29 and neither is the collection of all sets which don't contain themselves this eliminated the paradoxes that come
00:10:35 with self-reference hilbert and the formalists lived to fight another day but
00:10:41 self-reference refused to die quite that easily fast forward to the 1960s and mathematician hal wang was looking at
00:10:49 square tiles with different colors on each side like these the rules were that touching edges must
00:10:54 be the same color and you can't rotate or reflect tiles only slide them around the question was if
00:11:01 you're given an arbitrary set of these tiles can you tell if they will tile the plane that is will
00:11:06 they connect up with no gaps all the way out to infinity it turns out
00:11:13 you can't tell for an arbitrary set of tiles whether they will tile the plane or not
00:11:19 the problem is undecidable just like the fate of a pattern in conway's game of life in fact it's exactly the same problem
00:11:26 and that problem ultimately comes from self-reference as hilbert and the formalists were about to discover
00:11:35 hilbert wanted to secure the foundations of mathematics by developing a new system for mathematical proofs
00:11:41 systems of proof were an old idea going back to the ancient greeks a system of proof starts with axioms
00:11:47 basic statements that are assumed to be true like a straight line can be drawn between any two points
00:11:53 proofs are then constructed from those axioms using rules of inference methods for using existing statements to
00:11:59 derive new statements and these are chosen to preserve truth the existing statements are true
00:12:06 then so are the new ones hilbert wanted formal system of proof a symbolic logical language with a rigid set of
00:12:13 manipulation rules for those symbols logical and mathematical statements could then be translated into this system
00:12:19 if you drop a book then it will fall would be a then b and no human is immortal would be
00:12:29 hilbert and the formalists wanted to express the axioms of mathematics as symbolic statements in a formal system
00:12:36 and set up the rules of inference as the system's rules for symbol manipulation so russell along
00:12:42 with alfred north whitehead developed a formal system like this in their three-volume principia mathematica
00:12:49 published in 1913. principia mathematica is vast a total of nearly 2 000 pages of dense mathematical notation it takes 762 pages
00:13:00 just to get to a complete proof that one plus one equals two at which point russell and whitehead
00:13:06 dryly note the above proposition is occasionally useful the authors had originally planned a
00:13:13 fourth volume but unsurprisingly they were too worn out to complete it so yes the notation is dense and exhausting
00:13:19 but it is also exact unlike ordinary languages it leaves no room for errors or fuzzy
00:13:28 logic to creep in and most importantly it allows you to prove there were three big questions that
00:13:39 hilbert wanted answered about mathematics number one is math complete meaning is there a way to prove every
00:13:49 true statement does every true statement have a proof number two is mathematics consistent meaning is it free of contradictions
00:13:59 i mean if you can simultaneously prove a and not a then that's a real problem because you can prove
00:14:06 anything at all and number three is math decidable meaning is there an algorithm that can always determine
00:14:13 whether a statement follows from the axioms now hilbert was convinced that the answers to
00:14:22 all three of these questions was yes at a major conference in 1930 hilbert gave a fiery speech about these questions
00:14:29 he ended it with a line that summed up his formalist dream in opposition to the foolish ignorabus
00:14:36 which means we will not know our slogan shall be we must know we will know these words are literally
00:14:46 on his grave but by the time hilbert gave this speech his dream was already crumbling just the
00:14:52 day before at a small meeting at the same conference a 24 year old logician named kurt gerdel
00:14:58 explained that he had found the answer to the first of hilbert's three big questions about completeness
00:15:05 and the answer was no a complete formal system of mathematics was impossible the
00:15:10 only person who paid much attention was john von neumann one of hilbert's former students who
00:15:15 pulled godel aside to ask a few questions but the next year goodell published a proof of his incompleteness theorem
00:15:23 and this time everyone including hilbert this is how goodle's proof works goodl wanted to use logic and mathematics
00:15:38 to answer questions about the very system of logic and mathematics and so he took all these basic symbols of a
00:15:46 mathematical system and then he gave each one a number this is known as the symbol's goodall number
00:15:57 so the symbol for not gets the number one or has the goodall number two if then it's goodall number three now if
00:16:06 you're expressing all of these symbols with numbers then what do you do about the numbers themselves
00:16:13 well zero gets its own goodal number six and if you want to write a one you just put this successor symbol next
00:16:18 to it the immediate successor of zero is 1. and if you want to write 2 then you have
00:16:26 to write ss0 and that represents 2 and so on so you could represent any positive integer
00:16:31 this way granted it is cumbersome but it works and that is the point of this system
00:16:39 so now that we have goodall numbers for all of the basic symbols and all of the numbers we might want to use we can
00:16:45 start to write equations like we could write zero equals zero so these symbols have the goodal numbers
00:16:55 six five six and we can actually create a new card that represents
00:17:02 this equation zero equals zero and the way we do it is we take the prime numbers starting at
00:17:10 and we raise each one to the power of the goodal number of the symbol in our equation so we have 2 to the power of 6 times 3
00:17:16 to the power of 5 times 5 to the power of 6 equals 243 million so 243 million is the goodal number
00:17:29 of the whole equation zero equals zero we can write down little numbers for any set of symbols that you can imagine
00:17:38 so really this is an infinite deck of cards where any set of symbols that you want to write down
00:17:45 in a sequence you can represent with a unique goodell number and the beauty of this goodell number is
00:17:51 you can do a prime factorization of it and you can work out exactly what symbols made up
00:17:59 this card so in this whole pack of cards there are going to be true statements and there are going to be false
00:18:04 statements so how do you prove that something is true well you need to go to the axioms
00:18:12 the axioms also have their own goodal numbers which are formed in the same way so here's an axiom which says not
00:18:21 the successor of any number x equals zero which makes sense because in this system there are no negative numbers and so the
00:18:30 successor of any number cannot be zero so we can put down this axiom and then we can substitute in
00:18:38 zero for x saying that one does not equal zero and we've created a proof this is the simplest proof i can think of that shows
00:18:45 that one does not equal zero now this card for the proof
00:18:53 of one does not equal zero gets its own goodal number and the way we calculate this goodall number
00:18:58 is just as before we take the prime numbers and we raise 2 to the power of the axiom times 3 to the power of
00:19:08 1 does not equal 0 and we get a tremendously large number it would have 73 million digits
00:19:14 if you calculated it all out so i've just left it here in exponential notation as you can see these numbers get very
00:19:22 large and so you might want to start just calling them by letters so we could say this one
00:19:28 is goodal number a this is goodall number b goodall number c and so on
00:19:36 goodl goes to all this trouble to find this card which says there is no proof for the statement with
00:19:42 goodall number g the trick is that the goodall number of this card is
00:19:52 g so what this statement is really saying is this card is unprovable there is no proof anywhere in our infinite deck for this card
00:20:03 now think about it if it's false and there is a proof then what you have just proven is there
00:20:09 is no proof that would mean the mathematical system is inconsistent
00:20:21 the other alternative is that this card is true there is no proof for the statement with goodall number g
00:20:28 but that means this mathematical system has true statements in it that have no proof so your mathematical system is incomplete
00:20:38 and that is goodall's incompleteness theorem this is how he shows that any basic mathematical system that can do
00:20:47 fundamental arithmetic will always have statements within it which are true but which have
00:20:54 no proof there's a line in the tv show the office that echoes the self-referential paradox of
00:20:59 goodell's proof jim is my enemy but it turns out the jim is also his own worst enemy
00:21:05 and the enemy of my enemy is my friend so jim but because he is his own worst enemy
00:21:14 the enemy of my friend is my enemy so actually jim is my enemy but goodell's incompleteness theorem means
00:21:27 that truth and provability are not at all the same thing hilbert was wrong
00:21:32 there will always be true statements about mathematics that just cannot be proven now hilbert could console himself with
00:21:38 the hope that at least we could still prove maths consistent that is free of contradictions
00:21:44 but then goodell published his second incompleteness theorem in which he showed that any consistent
00:21:49 formal system of math cannot prove its own consistency so taken together goodl's two
00:21:56 incompleteness theorems say that the best you can hope for is a consistent yet incomplete system of math
00:22:04 but a system like that cannot prove its own consistency so some contradiction could always crop
00:22:08 up in the future revealing that the system you'd been working with had been inconsistent the
00:22:13 whole time and that leaves only the third and final big question from hilbert
00:22:19 is mathematics decidable that is is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows
00:22:24 from the axioms and in 1936 alan turing found a way to settle this question
00:22:32 but to do it he had to invent the modern computer in his time computers weren't machines they were people
00:22:40 often women who carried out long and tedious calculations turing imagined an entirely mechanical computer
00:22:47 he wanted it to be powerful enough to perform any computation imaginable but simple enough that you could reason
00:22:53 through its operation so he came up with a machine that takes as input an
00:22:59 infinitely long tape of square cells each containing a zero or a one the machine has a read
00:23:04 write head that can read one digit at a time then it can perform
00:23:11 one of only a few tasks overwrite a new value move left move right or simply halt halting means the program has run
00:23:22 to completion the program consists of a set of internal instructions you can think of
00:23:26 it like a flow chart that tells the machine what to do based on the digit it reads and its
00:23:32 internal state you could imagine exporting these instructions to any other turing machine
00:23:37 which would then perform in exactly the same way as the first although this sounds simple a turing
00:23:44 machine's arbitrarily large memory and program mean it can execute any computable algorithm if given enough time from addition and subtraction
00:23:54 to the entire youtube algorithm it can do anything a modern computer can that's what made
00:24:00 the turing machine so useful in answering hilbert's question on decidability when a touring machine halts
00:24:07 the program has finished running and the tape is the output but sometimes a touring machine never
00:24:13 halts maybe it gets stuck in an infinite loop is it possible to tell beforehand if a program will halt or not
00:24:21 on a particular input turing realized this halting problem was very similar to the decidability
00:24:26 problem if he could find a way to figure out if a turing machine would halt then it would also be possible to decide
00:24:33 if a statement followed from the axioms for example you could solve the twin prime conjecture by writing a turing
00:24:37 machine program that starts with the axioms and constructs all theorems that can be
00:24:42 produced in one step using the rules of inference then it constructs all theorems that can be
00:24:47 produced in one step from those and so on each time it generates a new theorem it checks if it's the twin prime
00:24:54 conjecture and if it is it halts if not it never halts so if you could solve the halting
00:25:01 problem you could solve the twin prime conjecture and all sorts of other unsolved questions
00:25:08 so turing said let's assume we can make a machine h that can determine whether any turing
00:25:12 machine will halt or not on a particular input you insert the program and its input
00:25:18 and h simulates what will happen printing out either halts or never halts for now
00:25:26 we don't worry about how h works we just know that it always works it always gives you
00:25:32 the right answer now we can modify the h machine by adding additional components one if it receives the output halts
00:25:38 immediately goes into an infinite loop another if it receives never holds
00:25:45 then it immediately halts we can call this entire new machine h plus and we can export the program
00:25:54 for that entire machine now what happens if we give this machine its own
00:26:02 code both as program and input well now h is simulating what h plus would do
00:26:09 given its own input essentially h has to determine the behavior of a machine that it
00:26:16 itself is a part of in this exact circumstance if h concludes that h plus never halts
00:26:31 if h thinks h plus will halt well then that necessarily forces h plus to loop
00:26:41 whatever output the halting machine h gives it turns out to be wrong there's a contradiction the only explanation can be that a
00:26:50 machine like h can't exist there's no way to tell in general if a touring machine will halt
00:26:55 or not on a given input and this means mathematics is undecidable there is no algorithm
00:27:05 that can always determine whether a statement is derivable from the axioms so something like the twin prime
00:27:11 conjecture might be unsolvable we might never know whether there are infinite twin primes
00:27:17 or not the problem of undecidability even crops up in physical systems in quantum mechanics
00:27:24 one of the most important properties of a many-body system is the difference in energy
00:27:29 between its ground state and its first excited state this is known as the spectral gap
00:27:36 some systems have a significant spectral gap whereas others are gapless there are a continuum of
00:27:41 energy levels all the way down to the ground state and this is important because
00:27:46 at low temperatures gapless quantum systems can undergo phase transitions while gapped systems cannot
00:27:52 they don't have the energy needed to overcome the spectral gap but figuring out if a system is gapped or
00:28:01 gapless has long been known to be a very difficult problem only recently in 2015 did mathematicians prove that in general
00:28:10 the spectral gap question is undecidable to quote the authors even a perfect complete description of
00:28:18 the microscopic interactions between a material's particles is not always enough to deduce its
00:28:24 macroscopic properties now remember that turing designed his machines to be as powerful computers
00:28:31 as it is possible to make to this day the best computational systems are those that can do everything a
00:28:36 touring machine can this is called touring completeness and it turns out
00:28:41 there are many such during complete systems although they are powerful every touring complete system comes with a catch
00:28:50 its own analog of the halting problem some undecidable property of the system wang tiles are touring complete their
00:28:56 halting problem is whether or not they'll tile the plane complex quantum systems
00:29:02 are turing complete and their halting problem is the spectral gap question and the game of life is turing complete
00:29:08 its halting problem is literally whether or not it halts there are many more examples of this
00:29:15 like airline ticketing systems magic the gathering powerpoint slides and excel spreadsheets
00:29:21 nearly every programming language in existence is designed to be turing complete but in theory we only need one
00:29:27 programming language because well you can program anything at all using any turing complete system
00:29:35 so here's a touring machine inside the game of life and since the game of life is itself
00:29:44 touring complete it should be capable of simulating itself and indeed
00:29:59 this is the game of life running on the game of life the real legacy of david hilbert's dream
00:30:14 is all of our modern computational devices kurt godel suffered bouts of mental instability later in life
00:30:22 convinced that people were trying to poison him he refused to eat eventually starving himself to death
00:30:32 hilbert died in 1943 his epitaph was his slogan from 1930. we must know we will know the truth is
00:30:41 we don't know sometimes we can't know but in trying to find out we can discover new things things that
00:30:49 change the world alan turing put his ideas about computing to practical use in world war ii
00:30:55 leading the team at bletchley park that built real calculating machines to crack nazi codes for the allies
00:31:01 by one estimate the intelligence turing and his colleagues gathered from decrypted messages
00:31:07 shortened the war by two to four years after the war turing and john von neumann designed the
00:31:11 first true programmable electronic computer eniac based on touring's designs
00:31:18 but turing didn't live to see his ideas develop much further in 1952 the british government convicted
00:31:24 him of gross indecency upon learning he was gay he was stripped of his security clearance and forced to
00:31:29 take hormones touring changed the world he is widely considered to be the most important
00:31:43 founding figure in computer science all modern computers are descended from his designs
00:31:49 but touring's ideas about computability came from his concept of the turing machine which came from thinking about hilbert's
00:31:56 question is math decidable so touring's code breaking machines and indeed all modern
00:32:03 computers stem from the weird paradoxes there is a hole at the bottom of math a hole that means we will never know everything
00:32:14 with certainty there will always be true statements that cannot be proven
00:32:20 and you might think this realization would have driven mathematicians mad and led to the disintegration of the
00:32:25 entire mathematical enterprise but instead thinking about this problem transformed the concept of
00:32:32 infinity changed the course of a world war and led directly to the invention of the device hey this video was sponsored by
00:32:50 brilliant a website full of interactive courses and quizzes that delve deep into topics like math physics and
00:32:56 computer science now if you've gotten this far into this video you're likely someone
00:33:00 who would love brilliant i've been going through their logic course and it's really got me thinking
00:33:07 the problems start out easy but get more and more challenging as you develop your understanding and that's what i love about the site i
00:33:13 love how it guides you not by telling you exactly but by exposing you to increasingly
00:33:17 sophisticated puzzles and at the end i feel like i've worked it out for myself which
00:33:22 essentially i have through their carefully curated selection of problems and with helpful hints and explanations
00:33:28 for when i get stuck now there were a lot of things i wanted to include in this video but couldn't
00:33:34 because it's already over half an hour long so if you want to explore these ideas
00:33:38 further i'd highly recommend their courses on number theory and computer science fundamentals
00:33:44 for viewers of this channel brilliant are offering 20 off an annual subscription to the first
