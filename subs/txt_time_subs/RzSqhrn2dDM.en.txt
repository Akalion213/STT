00:00:02 it comes at you as a breeze as a gust as a gale or in the scariest of situations a hurricane or tornado at speeds up to
00:00:10 400 kilometers an hour moving air can be as delightful as it can be frightening but how does wind happen here's one
00:00:21 sentence answer wind is caused by air flowing from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure long answer is
00:00:27 that there are a bunch of variables that affect wind formation speed and direction including the Sun and the
00:00:33 Earth's rotation let's back it up a bit the air that's all around you it's made of nitrogen molecules about 78% oxygen
00:00:40 molecules about 21% and water vapor between one and four percent when we talk about air pressure we're talking
00:00:46 about the amount of force that these molecules exert on a given area when a massive air warms it rises and therefore
00:00:52 exerts less pressure on the surface and especially if that air is moist that rising air can become unstable and
00:00:58 create cloudy rainy even stormy conditions that's why low pressure systems are often associated with bad
00:01:04 weather but that low you see on the weather map is only low in relation to the air around it there's always a
00:01:10 massive cooler drier air usually coming in from a polar region waiting to rush in push that low out of the way and sit
00:01:17 right on top of the land that's a high pressure system and when it dominates clear skies usually come with it so
00:01:22 think of the wind as the atmosphere is eternally futile struggled to find a balance between these two competing
00:01:28 systems air flows from a high pressure to low pressure systems to try to reach equilibrium and in doing so creates wind
00:01:34 The Closer the high and low-pressure areas are to each other the stronger the wind now unsurprisingly the Sun plays a
00:01:40 big part in all of this as it heats the surface of the earth about two percent of all the sun's energy that reaches our
00:01:46 planet is eventually converted into wind energy a small portion which we humans tried to harness the spin of our planet
00:01:52 also plays an important role if the earth didn't rotate global winds would pretty much blow in straight lines with
00:01:58 cold air flowing from the poles heating up the equator and then going back again but the Earth's rotation produces a
00:02:02 force on everything that's moving relative to the earth including air masses a phenomenon known as the
00:02:08 Coriolis effect that rotation deflects the direction of the winds to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the
00:02:13 left in the southern hemisphere put it together and these forces can do amazing things according to most sources
00:02:19 the highest surface wind speed ever recorded was at the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire wind gusts
00:02:26 during a particularly brutal storm in 1934 topped out at 372 km/h but in 1996 instruments about ten meters above the
00:02:35 surface recorded winds of 408 kilometers per hour during cyclone Olivia off the coast of Australia it's all the same to
