00:00:02 the following is a conversation with Thomas sent home he's a professor same you and co-creator of lebra's which is
00:00:09 the first AI system to be top human players in the game of heads-up No Limit Texas Hold'em he has published over 450
00:00:16 papers on game theory and machine learning including a best paper in 2017 at nips now renamed to new reps which is
00:00:25 where I caught up with him for this conversation his research and companies have had wide reaching impact in the
00:00:33 real world especially because he and his group not only proposed new ideas but also build systems to prove that these
00:00:42 ideas work in the real world this conversation is part of the MIT course on artificial general intelligence and
00:00:49 the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy subscribe on youtube itunes or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex
00:00:59 Friedman spelled Fri D and now here's my conversation with Thomas sent home can you describe at the high level the game
00:01:08 of poker Texas Hold'em heads-up Texas Hold'em for people who might not be familiar at this card game yeah happy to
00:01:16 so heads up No Limit Texas Hold'em has really emerged in the AI community as a main benchmark for testing these
00:01:23 application independent algorithms for imperfect information game solving and this is a game that's actually played by
00:01:33 humans you don't see that much on TV or casinos because well for obvious reasons but you do see it in some expert level
00:01:41 casinos and you see it in the best poker movies of all time it's actually an event in the World Series of Poker but
00:01:48 mostly it's played online and typically for pretty big sums of money and this is a game that usually only experts play so
00:01:57 if you recall to your home game on a Friday night it probably is not gonna be hits up no Limit Texas Hold'em it might
00:02:04 be no let me it takes us Hold'em in some cases but typically for a big group and it's not as competitive well heads up
00:02:10 means it's two-player so it's really like me against you Am I
00:02:16 you better much like chess or or or go in that sense but an imperfect information game which makes it much
00:02:21 harder because I have to deal with issues of you knowing things that I don't know and I know things that you
00:02:27 don't know instead of pieces being nicely laid on the board for both of us to see
00:02:34 so in Texas Hold'em there's a two cards that you only see the game on to you yeah there is they gradually lay out
00:02:42 some cards that add up overall to five cards that everybody can see yeah the imperfect nature of the information is
00:02:48 the two cards that you're holding on front yeah so as you said you know you first get two cards in private each and
00:02:55 then you this a betting round then you get three clubs in public on the table then there's a betting round then you
00:03:01 get the fourth card in public on the table they're spitting around then you get the five fifth card on the table
00:03:06 there's a bending drop so there's a total of four betting rounds and four torront√©s of information revelation if
00:03:12 you will the only the first tranche is private and they omits public from there and this is probably probably by far the
00:03:25 most popular game in AI and just the general public in terms of imperfect information so it's probably the most
00:03:34 popular spectator game to watch right so which is why it's a super exciting game tackle so it sits on the order of chess
00:03:41 I would say in terms of popularity in terms of AI setting it as the bar of what is intelligence
00:03:49 so in 2017 labret does how do you pronounce it Liberato lebra das lebra does beats little laughing they're a
00:03:56 little bit Latin LeBron is beat a few for expert human players can you describe that event what you learned
00:04:05 from it what was it like what was the process in general for people who have not read the papers and study yeah so
00:04:13 the event was that we invited four of the top 10 players with these are specialist players in heads-up no Limit
00:04:18 Texas Hold'em which is very important because this game is actually quite different than the the multiplayer
00:04:25 version we brought me in to Pittsburgh to play at the reverse casino for twenty days we wanted to get a
00:04:31 hundred and twenty thousand hands in because we wanted to get statistical significance so it's a lot of hands for
00:04:40 humans to play even for this top pros who play fairly quickly normally so we couldn't just have one of them play so
00:04:48 many hands twenty days they were playing basically morning to evening and he raised two hundred thousand as a little
00:04:56 incentive for them to play and the setting was so that they didn't all get fifty thousand we actually paid them out
00:05:04 based on how they did against the AI each so they had an incentive to play as hard as they could whether they're way
00:05:12 ahead the way behind or right at the mark of beating the AI and you don't make any money unfortunately right no we
00:05:19 can't make any money so so originally a couple of years earlier I actually explored whether we could actually play
00:05:25 for money because that would be of course interesting as well to play against the top people for money but the
00:05:32 Pennsylvania Gaming Board said no so so if we couldn't so this is much like an exhibit like for a musician or a boxer
00:05:39 or something like that nevertheless you're keeping track of the money and brought us one close to two
00:05:48 million dollars I think so so if there if it was for real money if you were able to earn money that was a quite
00:05:55 impressive and inspiring achievement just a few details what what were the players looking at I mean were they
00:06:01 behind the computer what was the interface like yes there they were playing much like they normally do these
00:06:07 top players when they play this game they play mostly online so they used to playing through what UI yes and they did
00:06:13 the same thing here so there was this layout you could imagine there's a table on the screen this the the human sitting
00:06:21 there and then there's the AI sitting there and the the screen source everything is happening the cards coming
00:06:27 out and so the bets being made and we also had the betting history for the human so if the human for what what had
00:06:33 happened in the ham so far they could actually reference back and and and so forth is there a reason
00:06:39 they were given access to the betting history for well we just  it's a it didn't really matter that they wouldn't
00:06:47 have forgotten anyway these are top quality people but we just want to put out there so it's not a question for
00:06:54 human for getting and the AI somehow trying to get advantage of better memory so what was that like I mean that was an
00:07:00 incredible accomplishment so what did it feel like before the event did you have doubt hope
00:07:08 where was your confidence at yeah that's great so a great question so eighteen months earlier I had organized the
00:07:15 similar brains versus AI competition with our previous a I call clerical and we couldn't beat the humans so this time
00:07:23 around it was only eighteen months later and I knew that this new AI Lovato's was way stronger but it's hard to say how
00:07:31 you'll do against the top humans before you try so I thought we had about a 50/50 shot and the international betting
00:07:39 sites put us a us as a four to one or five to one underdog so it's kind of interesting that people really believe
00:07:48 in people and I get over AI not just people people don't just believe over believing themselves but they have
00:07:52 overconfidence in other people as well compared to the performance of AI and yeah so we were afford to 105 to 108
00:08:03 beating the humans in a row we were still 50/50 on the international betting sites do you think there's something
00:08:10 special and magical about poker and in the way people think about it in a sense you have I mean even in chess there's no
00:08:19 Hollywood movies poker is this the star of many movies and there's this feeling that certain human facial expressions
00:08:31 and body language eye movement all these tells are critical to poker you can look into somebody's soul understand their
00:08:38 betting strategy and so on there so that's probably why the possibly do you think that is why people have a
00:08:45 confidence that humans will outperform because AI systems cannot in construct perceive these kinds of tells
00:08:52 they're only looking at betting patterns and and nothing else the betting patterns and and statistics so what's
00:09:03 more important to you if you step back and human players human versus human what's the role these tells of these
00:09:14 ideas that we romanticize yeah so I split it into two parts so one is why do humans trust he much more than AI and
00:09:23 all have overconfidence in humans yes I think that's that's not really related to tell a question it's just that
00:09:30 they've seen these top players how good they are and they're really fantastic so it's just hard to believe therefore that
00:09:37 the Navy I could beat them yeah so I think that's where that comes from and and that's actually maybe a more general
00:09:42 lesson about the AI that until you've seen it over perform a human it's hard to believe it it could but then the
00:09:51 tails a lot of these top players they're so good at hiding tails that among the top players it's actually not really
00:10:00 worth it for them to invest a lot of effort trying to find tails in each other because there's a so good at
00:10:08 hiding them so yes at the kind of Friday evening game tells are gonna be a huge thing you can read other people and if
00:10:14 you're a good reader you you'll read them like an open book but at the top levels of poker no details become a list
00:10:20 of the much much smaller and smaller aspect of the game as you go to the top levels the the amount of strategies the
00:10:29 amount of possible actions is is very large ten to the power of one hundred plus so there has to be some I've read a
00:10:41 few the papers related it has it has to form some abstractions of various hands and actions so what kind of abstractions
00:10:49 are effective for the game of poker yeah so you're exactly right so when you go from a game tree that's ten to the 161
00:10:56 especially in an imperfect information game it's way too large to solve directly even with our fastest ik
00:11:05 finding algorithms so you wanna abstract it first and abstraction in games is much trickier than abstraction in mdps
00:11:15 or other single agent settings because you have these abstraction pathologies that if I have a finer grained
00:11:21 abstraction the strategy that I can get from that for the real game might actually be worse than the strategy I
00:11:26 can get from the coarse-grained abstraction if you have to be very careful now the the kinds of
00:11:31 abstractions just to zoom out we're talking about there's the hands abstractions and then there's betting
00:11:38 strategies yeah what I think actions yeah baiting access or so there's information obstruction to talk about
00:11:44 general games information abstraction which is the abstraction of what chance does and this would be the cards in the
00:11:51 case of poker and then there's action abstraction which is abstracting the actions of the actual players which
00:11:59 would be bits in the case of poker yourself and the other players yes yourself and other players and for
00:12:09 information abstraction we were completely automated so these were these are algorithms but they do what we call
00:12:17 potential aware abstraction where we don't just look at the value of the hand but also how it might materialize in the
00:12:23 good or bad hands over time and it's a certain kind of bottom-up process with integer programming there and clustering
00:12:29 and various aspects how do you build build this abstraction and then in the action abstraction there it's largely
00:12:40 based on how humans other and other AIS have played this game in the past but in the beginning we actually use an
00:12:47 automated action abstraction technology which is provably convergent that it finds the optimal combination of eight
00:12:55 sizes but it's not very scalable so we couldn't use it for the whole game but we used it for the first couple of
00:13:00 betting actions so what's more important the strength of the hand so the information retraction or the how you
00:13:10 play them the actions does you know the romanticized notion again is that it doesn't matter what hands you
00:13:18 have that the actions the betting may be the way you win no matter what hands you have yeah so that's why you have to play
00:13:24 a lot of hands so that the role of luck gets smaller so you could otherwise get lucky and get some good hands and then
00:13:31 you're gonna win the match even with thousands of hands you can get lucky because there's so much variance in No
00:13:39 Limit Texas Hold'em because if we both go all-in it's a huge stack or variant so there are these massive swings in No
00:13:48 Limit Texas Hold'em so that's why you have to play not just thousands but over a hundred thousand hands don't get
00:13:56 statistical significance let me ask another way this question if you didn't even look at your hands but they didn't
00:14:04 know that the your opponents didn't know that how well would you be able to do oh that's a good question there's actually
00:14:10 I heard this story that this is Norwegian female poker player goal and at uber stud who's actually won a
00:14:16 tournament by doing exactly that but that would be extremely rare so so I cannot really play well the hands do
00:14:28 have some role to play oh yes so LeBron is does not use as far as I understand a used learning methods deep learning is
00:14:40 there room for learning in you know there's no reason why lab artist doesn't you know combined with an alphago type
00:14:47 approach for estimating the quality for function estimator what are your thoughts on this maybe as compared to
00:14:55 another algorithm which I'm not that familiar with deep stack the the engine that does use deep learning that it's
00:15:01 unclear how well it does but nevertheless uses deep learning so what are your thoughts about learning methods
00:15:08 to aid in the way that teller Broadus plays the game of poker yeah so as you said Lee barratto's did not use learning
00:15:15 methods and played very well without them since then we have actually actually here we have a couple of papers
00:15:22 on things that do use learning technique Saxon so and deep learning in particular and the sort of the way you're talking
00:15:32 about where it's learning an evaluation function but in imperfect information games unlike let's say in Co or now now
00:15:43 also in chess and shogi it's not some sufficient to learn an evaluation for a state because the value of an
00:15:54 information set depends not only on the exact state but it also depends on both players beliefs like if I have a bad
00:16:03 hand I'm much better off if the opponent thinks I'm have a good hand and vice versa if I have a good hand I'm much
00:16:09 better off if the opponent believes I have a bad hand so the value of a state is not just a function of the cards it
00:16:18 depends on if you will the path of play but only to the extent that is captured in the belief distributions so so that's
00:16:27 why it's not as simple as as it is imperfect information games another one I'd say it's simple there either it's of
00:16:33 course very complicated computationally there too but at least conceptually it's very straightforward there's a state
00:16:38 there's an evaluation function you can try to learn it here you have to do something more and what we do is in one
00:16:48 of these papers we're looking at allowing where we allow with the opponent to actually take different
00:16:54 strategies at the leaf of the search tree as F if you will and and that is a different way of doing it and it doesn't
00:17:02 assume therefore a particular way that the opponent plays but it allows opponent to choose from a set of
00:17:09 different continuation strategies and that forces us to not be too optimistic in our local head search and that's
00:17:17 that's one way you can do sound look ahead search in imperfect information games which is very different difficult
00:17:25 and in us you were asking about deep stack what they did it was very different than what we do either in Lee
00:17:31 brothers or in this new work they were gender and Umrah generating various situations in the game then they
00:17:38 were doing Luca head from there to the end of the game as if that was a start of a different game and then they were
00:17:45 using deep learning to learn those values of those states but the states were not just the physical states they
00:17:52 include the belief distributions when you talk about look ahead for deep stack or with libertas does it mean
00:18:01 considering every possibility that the game can involve is that we're talking about extremely sort of like this
00:18:07 exponentially growth of a tree yes so we're talking about exactly that much like you do in Alpha Beta search or
00:18:16 want to crawl to research but with different techniques so there's a different search algorithm and then we
00:18:21 have to deal with the leaves differently so if you think about what Lee brothers did we didn't have to worry about this
00:18:27 because we only did it at the end of the game so we would always terminate into a real situation and we would know what to
00:18:35 payout this it didn't do this depth limited loka heads but now in this new paper which is called depth limited
00:18:41 I think it's called depth limited research for imperfect information games we can actually do sound depth limited
00:18:48 look at it so we can actually started with a look ahead from the beginning of the game on
00:18:53 because that's too complicated to do for this whole long game so in Lee brothers we were just doing it
00:18:58 for the end so and then the other side this belief distribution so is it explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs
00:19:08 that the opponent might have yeah yeah it is explicitly modeled but it's not assumed the beliefs are actually output
00:19:17 not input of course the starting beliefs are input but they just fall from the rules of the game because we know that
00:19:24 the dealer deals uniformly from the dick so I know that every pair of cards that you might have is equally likely I know
00:19:31 that for a fact that's as follows from the rules of the game of course except the two cards that
00:19:36 I have I know you don't have those yes you have to take that into account that's called card removal and that's
00:19:42 very important is the dealing always coming from a single deck in the heads up so you can assume single deck know
00:19:50 that if some if if I have the ace of spades I know you don't have an ace of spades okay so in the beginning your belief is
00:19:57 basically the fact that it's a fair dealing of hands but how do you adjust start to adjust that belief well that's
00:20:05 a where this beauty of games here it comes so nash equilibrium which john nash introduced in 1950 introduces what
00:20:14 rational play is when you have more than one player and these are pairs of strategies where strategies are
00:20:23 contingency plans one for each player so neither player wants to deviate to a different strategy given
00:20:29 that the other doesn't deviate but as a side effect you get the beliefs from Bayes rule so Nash equilibrium really
00:20:37 isn't just deriving in these imperfect information games Nash equilibrium doesn't just define strategies it also
00:20:45 defines beliefs for both us and it defines beliefs for each state so at the each state it's if they take all
00:20:54 information sets at each information set in the game there's a set of different states that we might be in but I don't
00:21:01 know which one we're in Nash equilibrium tells me exactly what is a probability distribution over those real world
00:21:09 states in my mind how does naturally give you that distribution so why I'll do a simple example so you know the game
00:21:18 rock-paper-scissors so we can draw it as player 1 moves first and then player 2 moves but of course it's important that
00:21:25 player 2 doesn't know what player 1 moved otherwise player 2 would win every time so we can draw that as an
00:21:31 information set where player 1 makes one of three moves first and then there's an information set for player 2 so player 2
00:21:40 doesn't know which of those nodes the world is it but once we know the strategy for player 1 Nash equilibrium
00:21:47 will say that you play 1/3 Rock 1/3 paper 1/3 caesars from that I can derive my beliefs of the information set that
00:21:54 they wanted 1/3 wants it though so Bayes gives you that basis you but is that specific to a particular player or is it
00:22:03 is there something you quickly update with the game theory isn't really player specific so that's what also why we
00:22:12 don't need any data we don't need any history how these particular humans played in the past or how any AI or even
00:22:18 had played before it's all about rationality so we just think the AI just thinks about what would a rational
00:22:26 opponent do and what would I do if I were right I am rational and that that's that's the idea of game theory so it's
00:22:34 really a data free opponent free approach sir comes from the design of the game as opposed to the design of the
00:22:41 player exactly if there's no opponent modeling per se I mean we've done some work on combining opponent modeling with
00:22:47 game theory so you couldn't exploit weak players even more but that's another strand and in the Lee brothers we didn't
00:22:53 turn that on because I decided that these players are too good and when you start to exploit an opponent you'll
00:23:00 typically open yourself up self up to exploitation and these guys have so few holes to exploit and they're world's
00:23:06 leading experts in counter exploitation so I decided that we're not gonna turn that stuff on actually I saw a few
00:23:12 papers exploiting opponents it sound very interesting to explore do you think there's room for exploitation generally
00:23:21 outside of LeBron us is is there subject or people differences that could be exploited maybe not just in poker but in
00:23:30 general interactions negotiations all these other domains that yours considering yeah I definitely we've done
00:23:36 some work on that and I really like their work at hybridize is the two so you figure out what would a rational
00:23:44 opponent do and by the way that's safe in these zero-sum games two player zero-sum games because if the opponent
00:23:50 does something irrational yes it might show throw off my beliefs but the amount that the player can gain by throwing off
00:23:59 my belief is always less than they lose by playing poorly so so it's safe but still if somebody's weak as a player you
00:24:08 might want to play differently to exploit them more so that you can think about it this way a game theoretic
00:24:17 strategies are unbeatable but it doesn't maximally beat the other opponent so the winnings per hand might be better with a
00:24:25 different strategy and the hybrid is that you start from a game theoretic approach and then as you gain data from
00:24:31 about the opponent in certain parts of the game tree that in those parts of the game tree you start to tweak your
00:24:38 strategy more and more towards exploitation while still staying fairly close to the game theoretic strategy so
00:24:44 as to not open yourself up to exploitation too much how do you do that do you try to vary up
00:24:53 strategies make it unpredictable it's like what is it tit-for-tat strategies in prisoner's
00:25:02 dilemma or well it doesn't that that's a repeated game kind of prisoner's dilemma repeats it games but but even there
00:25:09 there's no proof that says that that's the best thing but experimentally it actually does does does well so what
00:25:15 kind of games are there first of all I don't know if this is something that you could just summarize there's perfect
00:25:20 information games or all the informations on the table there is imperfect information games there's
00:25:28 repeated games you play over and over there's zero-sum games there's nonzero-sum games yeah and then there's
00:25:37 a really important distinction you're making two-player versus more players so what are what other games out there and
00:25:46 what's the difference for example with this two-player game versus more players yeah what are the key differences right
00:25:54 here so let me start from the the basic so a repeated game is a game where the same exact game is played over and over
00:26:06 in these extensive form games where think about three form maybe with these information says to represent incomplete
00:26:14 information you can have kind of repetitive interactions even repeated games are a special case of that by the
00:26:21 way but if the game doesn't have to be exactly the same selectively sourcing all trips yes we kind of see it the same
00:26:27 supply base year to year but what I'm buying is a little different every time and the supply base is a little
00:26:32 different every time and so on so it's not really repeated so to find a purely repeated game is actually very rare in
00:26:40 the world so they're really a very coarse model of what's going on then if you move up from repeat just repeated
00:26:50 simple repeated matrix games not all the way to extensive form games but in between they're stochastic games where you know
00:26:59 this these think about it like these little matrix games and when you take an action and your
00:27:05 home takes an action they determine not which next state I'm going to next game I'm going to but the distribution over
00:27:13 next games where I might be going to so so that's the stochastic game but it's like matrix games repeated stochastic
00:27:21 games extensive form games that is from less to more general and and poker is an example of the last one so it's really
00:27:30 the most general setting extensive form games and that's kind of what the AI community has been working on and being
00:27:37 benched marked on with this heads-up No Limit Texas Hold'em can you describe extensive form games
00:27:42 what was the motto here yeah so if you imagine with the tree form so it's really the tree form like in chess
00:27:48 there's a search tree versus a matrix is a matrix yeah and that's the new matrix is called the matrix form or by matrix
00:27:56 form or normal form game and here you have the tree form so you can actually do certain types of reasoning there that
00:28:02 you'll lose the information when you go to normal form there's a certain form of equivalence like if you go from three
00:28:09 form and you say it every possible contingency plan is the strategy then I can actually go back to the normal form
00:28:16 but I lose some information from the lack of sequentiality then the multiplayer versus two-player
00:28:22 distinction is an important one so two-player games in zero-sum are conceptually easier and computationally
00:28:34 easier there's still huge like this one this one but they're conceptually easier and computationally easier in that
00:28:41 conceptually you don't have to worry about which equilibrium is the other guy going to play when there are multiple
00:28:49 because any equilibrium strategy is a best response to any other equilibrium strategy so I can play a different
00:28:55 equilibrium from you and we'll still get the right values of the game that falls apart even with two players when you
00:29:01 have general some games even without cooperation just even without cooperation so there's a big gap from
00:29:08 two player zero-sum to two-player general sum or even to three player zero-sum that's that's a big gap
00:29:16 at least in theory can you maybe not mathematically provide the intuition why it all falls apart with three or more
00:29:23 players it seems like you should still be able to have a Nash equilibrium that yeah that's instructive that holds okay
00:29:36 so it is true that all finite games have a Nash equilibrium so this is what your Nash actually proved so they do have a
00:29:43 Nash equilibrium that's not a problem the problem is that there can be many and then there's a question of which
00:29:51 equilibrium to select so and if you select your strategy from a different equilibrium and I select mind then did
00:30:00 what does that mean I and in this non zero sum games we may lose some joint benefits we hope by being just simply
00:30:08 stupid we could actually both be better off if we did something else yes and in three player you get other problems also
00:30:14 like collusion that maybe you and I can get up on a third player and we can do radically better by colluding so that
00:30:21 there are lots of issues that come up there so no Brown student you workers on this has mentioned I looked through the AMA
00:30:30 and read it he mentioned that the ability of poker players to collaborate will make the game he was asked the
00:30:36 question of how would you make the game of poker or both of you were asked the question how would you make the game of poker
00:30:45 beyond being solvable by current AI methods and he said that there's not many ways of making poker more difficult
00:30:56 but collaboration or cooperation between players would make it extremely difficult so can you provide the
00:31:03 intuition behind why that is if you agree with that idea yeah so we've done a lot of work coalitional games and we
00:31:12 actually have a paper here with my other student cappella Farina and some other collaborators on after net nips on that
00:31:18 actually just came back from the poster session where we present life so when you have a collusion it's a it's a
00:31:24 different problem yes and it typically gets even harder then even the game representations some of
00:31:31 the game representations don't really allow go to computation so we actually introduced a new game representation for
00:31:39 for that is that kind of cooperation part of the model is are you do you have do you have information about the fact
00:31:47 that other players are cooperating or is it just this chaos that where nothing is known so there's some something's
00:31:53 unknown can you give an example of a collusion type game or Z you select breach that so think about bridge it's
00:32:01 like when you and I are on a team our payoffs are the same the problem is that we can't talk so so when I get my
00:32:09 cards I can't whisper to you what my cards are that would not be allowed so we have to somehow coordinate our
00:32:19 strategies ahead of time and only ahead of time and then there are certain signals we can talk about but they have
00:32:25 to be such that the other team also understands them so so that that's that's an example where the coordination
00:32:32 is already built into the rules of the game but in many other situations like auctions or negotiations or diplomatic
00:32:41 relationships poker it's not really built-in but it still can be very helpful for the coders I've read you
00:32:49 right somewhere the negotiations you come to the table with prior like a strategy that like that you're willing
00:32:57 to do and not willing to do those kinds of things so how do you start to now moving away from poker movie beyond
00:33:04 poker into other applications like negotiations how do you start applying this to other and to other domains
00:33:11 yeah even real world domains that you've worked on yeah I actually have two start-up companies doing exactly that
00:33:17 one is called strategic machine and that's for kind of build applications gaming sports all sorts of things like
00:33:25 that any applications of this to business and to sports and to gaming to various types of things for in finance
00:33:34 electricity markets and so on and the other is called strategy robot where we are taking this to military secure
00:33:41 the cyber security and intelligence applications I think you worked a little bit in how he put it advertisement sort
00:33:54 of suggesting ad kind of thing yeah auction that's another component optimized markets optimized but that's
00:34:00 much more about a combinatorial market and optimization based technology that's not using these game theoretic reasoning
00:34:10 technologies I think okay so what sort of high level do you think about our ability to use game theoretic concepts
00:34:19 to model human behavior do you think do you think human behavior is amenable to this kind of modeling so outside of the
00:34:25 poker games and where have you seen it done successfully in your work I'm not sure the goal really is modeling humans
00:34:35 like for example if I'm playing a zero-sum game yes I don't really care that the opponent is actually following
00:34:43 my model of rational behavior because if they're not that's even better for me right so so they see with the opponents
00:34:52 and games there's a the prerequisite is that you've formalized the interaction in some way that can be amenable to
00:35:02 analysis and you've done this amazing work with mechanism design designing games that have certain outcomes but so
00:35:13 I'll tell you an example for my for my world of autonomous vehicles right we're studying pedestrians and pedestrians and
00:35:20 cars negotiating this nonverbal communication there's this weird and game dance of tension where pedestrians
00:35:28 are basically saying I trusted you won't kill me and so as a jaywalker I will step onto the road even though I'm
00:35:33 breaking the law and there's this tension and the question is we really don't know how to model that well in
00:35:41 trying to model intent and so people sometimes bring up ideas of game theory and so on do you think that aspect of
00:35:50 human behavior can use these kinds of imperfect information approaches modeling how do we how do you start to attack a
00:35:58 problem like that when you don't even know how the game design the game to describe the situation in order to solve
00:36:05 it okay so I haven't really thought about jaywalking but one thing that I think could be a good application in an
00:36:13 autonomous vehicles is the following so let's say that you have fleets of autonomous cars operated by different
00:36:19 companies so maybe here's the way more fleet and here's the uber fleet if you think about the rules of the road they
00:36:26 define certain little rules but that still leaves a huge strategy space open like as a simple example when cars merge
00:36:34 you know how he must merge you know they slow down and look at each other and try to I try to merge wouldn't it be better
00:36:41 if these situations would all repeat pre-negotiated so we can actually merge at full speed and we know that this is
00:36:48 the situation this is how we do it and it's all gonna be faster but there are way too many situations to negotiate
00:36:55 manually so you could do use automated negotiation this is the idea at least you could use automated negotiation to
00:37:02 negotiate all of these situations or many of them in advance and of course it might be that hey maybe you're not gonna
00:37:08 always let me go first maybe you said okay well in these situations all let you go first but in
00:37:14 exchange you're gonna give me - how much you're gonna let me go first in this situation yes
00:37:19 so it's this huge combinatorial negotiation and do you think there's room in that example of merging to model
00:37:26 this whole situation is an imperfect information game or do you really want to consider it to be a perfect no that's
00:37:32 a good question yeah that's a good question I'm paid the price of assuming that you don't know everything yeah I
00:37:41 don't know it's certainly much easier games with perfect information are much easier so if you can get away with it
00:37:50 you should but if the real situation is of imperfect information then you're going to have to deal with in for
00:37:56 imperfect information great so what lessons have you learned the annual computer poker competition an incredible
00:38:03 accomplishment of AI you know you look at the history of deep blue go these kind of moments when I stepped
00:38:12 up in an engineering effort and a scientific effort combined to beat the best human players so what do you take
00:38:19 away from this whole experience what have you learned about designing it has systems that play these kinds of games
00:38:27 and what does that mean for sort of AI in general for the future of IAI development yeah so that's a good
00:38:33 question so there's so much to say about it I do like this type of performance oriented research although in my group
00:38:42 we go all the way from like idea to theory to experiments to big system fielding the commercialization so we
00:38:48 spend that spectrum but I think that in a lot of situations in AI you really have to build the big systems and
00:38:56 evaluate them at a scale before you know what works and doesn't and we've seen that in the computational game theory
00:39:02 community that there are a lot of techniques that look good in the small but then they cease to look good in the
00:39:08 large and we've also seen that there are a lot of techniques that look superior in theory and I really mean in terms of
00:39:16 convergence rates better like first-order methods better convergence rates like the CFR based based
00:39:22 algorithms yet the CFR pay based algorithms are the fastest in practice so it really tells me that you have to
00:39:28 test this in reality the theory isn't tight enough if you will to tell you which algorithms are better than the
00:39:37 others and you have to look at these things that in the large because any sort of projections you do from the
00:39:42 small and at least in this domain be very misleading so that that's kind of from from a kind of science and
00:39:48 engineering perspective from personal perspective it's been just a wild experience in that with the first poker
00:39:56 competition the first or first brains versus AI man-machine poker competition that we organized there had been by the
00:40:02 way for other poker games there had been previous competitions but this was for heads up No Limit this was the first and
00:40:09 I probably became the most hated person in the world of Poker and I didn't mean to III size that they cracked in the
00:40:18 game for yeah it was a lot of people felt that it was a real threat to the whole game the whole
00:40:24 existence of the game if AI becomes better than humans people would be scared to play poker because there are
00:40:30 the superhuman AI is running around taking their money and you know all of that so so I just it's just really
00:40:37 aggressive just in the comments were super aggressive I got everything it's just short of death threats do you
00:40:43 think the same was true for chess because right now they just completed the World Championships and chess and
00:40:49 humans just started ignoring the fact that there's AI systems now that I'll perform humans and they still enjoy the
00:40:55 game is still a beautiful game that's what I think yeah and I think the same thing happens in poker and so I didn't
00:41:01 think of myself as somebody was gonna kill the game and I don't think I did yeah I've really learned to love this
00:41:07 game I wasn't a poker player before but learn so many new ones is about it from these AIS and they've really changed how
00:41:13 the game is played by the way so they have these very Martian ways of playing poker and the top humans are now
00:41:19 incorporating those types of strategies into their own play so if anything to me our work has made poker a richer more
00:41:30 interesting game for humans to play not something that is gonna steer him as away from it entirely just a quick
00:41:36 comment and something you said which is if I may say so in academia is a little bit rare sometimes it's pretty brave to
00:41:45 put your ideas to the test in the way you described saying that sometimes good ideas don't
00:41:51 work when you actually try to apply them at scale and so where does that come from I mean what if you could do a
00:42:00 advice for people what what drives you in that sense were you always this way I mean it takes a brave person I guess is
00:42:06 what I'm saying to test their ideas and to see if this thing actually works against human top human players and so
00:42:13 on yeah I don't know about brave but it takes a lot of work it takes a lot of work and a lot of time to organize do
00:42:21 make something big and to organize an event and stuff like that and what drives you in that effort because you
00:42:27 could still I would argue get a best paper award and nips as you did in 17 without doing this that's right yes
00:42:36 and so so in general I believe it's very important to do things in in the real world and at scale and that's really
00:42:46 where the the the pudding if you will proof is in the pudding that's what that's where it is in this particular
00:42:52 case it was kind of a competition between different groups and for many years as to who can be the first one to
00:43:00 beat the top humans that heads up No Limit Texas Hold'em so it became it became kind of a like a competition who
00:43:11 can get there yeah so a little friendly competition could be I can do wonders for progress yes so the topic of
00:43:19 mechanism design which is really interesting also kind of new to me except as an observer if I don't know
00:43:26 politics and any I'm an observer of mechanisms but you write in your paper an automated mechanism design that I
00:43:35 quickly read so mechanism design is designing the rules of the game so you get a certain desirable outcome and you
00:43:43 have this work on doing so in an automatic fashion as opposed to fine-tuning it so what have you learned
00:43:51 from those efforts if you look say I don't know at complex it's like our political system can we design our
00:44:00 political system to have in an automated fashion to have outcomes that we want can we design something like traffic
00:44:09 lights to be smart where it gets outcomes that we want so what are the lessons you draw from that work yeah so
00:44:17 I still very much believe in the automated mechanism design direction yes but it's not a panacea
00:44:25 there are impossibility results in mechanism design saying that there is no mechanism that accomplishes objective X
00:44:35 in Class C so so they it's not gonna there's no way using any mechanism design tools manual or automated
00:44:42 to do certain things in mechanism design he can't describe that again so meaning there it's impossible to achieve that
00:44:51 yeah yes it was likely impossible so so so these are these are not statements about human ingenuity who might come up
00:44:57 with something smart these are proofs that if you wanna accomplish properties X in Class C that is not to oppose with
00:45:05 any mechanism the good thing about automated mechanism design is that we're not really designing for a class we're
00:45:13 designing for specific settings at the time so even if there's an impossibility result for the whole class it just
00:45:21 doesn't mean that all of the cases in the class are impossible it just means that some of the cases are impossible so
00:45:27 we can actually carve these islands of possibility within these known impossible classes and we've actually
00:45:33 done that so what one of the famous results in mechanism design is a Meyer sham set its weight theorem for pi Roger
00:45:40 Myerson and Mark Satterthwaite from 1983 so it's an impossibility of efficient trade under imperfect information we
00:45:48 show that you can in many settings avoid that and get the efficient trade anyway depending on how they design the game
00:45:55 okay so depending how you design the game and of course it's not it doesn't in any way any way contradict to
00:46:02 impossibility result or impossibility results is still there but it just finds spots within this impossible class where
00:46:11 in those spots you don't have time possibility sorry if I'm going a bit philosophical but what lessons you draw
00:46:18 towards like I mentioned politics or human interaction and designing mechanisms for outside of just these
00:46:31 kinds of trading or auctioning or purely formal games our human interaction like a political system what how do you think
00:46:41 it's applicable to yeah politics or to business to negotiations these kinds of things designing rules that have certain
00:46:51 outcomes yeah yeah I do think so have you seen success that successfully done yes and really oh you mean mechanism
00:46:57 design or automated make automated mechanism design but so so mechanism design itself has had fairly limited
00:47:07 success so far there are certain cases but most of the real-world situations are actually not sound from a mechanism
00:47:15 design perspective even in those cases where they've been designed by very knowledgeable mechanism design people
00:47:21 the people are typically just taking some insights from the theory and applying those insights into the real
00:47:27 world rather than applying the mechanisms directly so one famous example of is the FCC spectrum auctions
00:47:36 so I've also had a small role in that and very good economists have been where excellent economists have been working
00:47:44 on that with no game theory yet the rules that are designed in practice they're they're such that bidding
00:47:50 truthfully is not the best strategy usually mechanism design we try to make things easy for the participants so
00:47:57 telling the truth is the best strategy but but even in those very high stakes auctions where you have tens of billions
00:48:04 of dollars worth of expect from being auctioned truth-telling is not the best strategy and by the way nobody knows
00:48:12 even a single optimal bidding strategy for those auctions what's the challenge of coming up with an optimum because
00:48:18 there's a lot of players and there's a lot of players but many items for sale and the these mechanisms are such that
00:48:26 even with just two items or one item bidding truthfully wouldn't be the best strategy if you look at the history of
00:48:36 AI it's marked by seminal events and alphago being a world champion human go player I would put librettist winning
00:48:43 the heads of no-limit hold'em as one of such event thank you and what do you think is the next such event whether it's in
00:48:56 your life or in the broadly AI community that you think might be out there that would surprise the world so that's a
00:49:03 great question and I don't really know the answer in terms of game solving hits up No Limit Texas Hold'em really was the
00:49:12 one remaining widely agreed-upon benchmark so that was the big milestone now are there other things yes certainly
00:49:20 there are but there there is not one that the community has kind of focused on so what could be other things there
00:49:27 are groups working on StarCraft there are groups working on dota2 these are video games yes or you could have like
00:49:36 diplomacy or Hanavi you know things like that these are like recreational games but none of them are really acknowledged
00:49:44 that's kind of the main next challenge problem like chess or go or heads-up No Limit Texas Hold'em was so I don't
00:49:52 really know in the game solving space what is or what will will be the next benchmark I hope kind of hope that there will be a
00:49:58 next benchmark because really the different groups working on the same problem really drove these application
00:50:05 independent techniques for put very quickly over ten years do you think there's an open problem that excites you
00:50:11 that you start moving away from games into real world games like say the stock market trading yeah that's that's kind
00:50:21 of how I am so I am probably not going to work as hard on these recreational benchmarks I'm doing to startups on game
00:50:31 solving technology strategic machine and strategy robot and we're really interested in pushing this stuff into
00:50:38 practice what do you think would be really you know a powerful result that would be surprising that would be if you
00:50:52 can say I mean you know five years ten years from now something that statistically you would say is not very
00:51:00 likely but if there's a breakthrough what achieve yeah so I think that overall we're in a very different
00:51:09 situation in game theory than we are in let's say machine learning yes so in machine learning it's a fairly
00:51:15 mature technology and it's very broadly applied and proven success in the real world in game solving there are almost
00:51:23 no applications yet we have just become superhuman which machine learning you could argue
00:51:31 happened in the 90s if not earlier and at least some supervised learning at certain complex supervised learning applications
00:51:39 now I think a next challenge problem I know you're not asking about this way you're you're asking about the
00:51:43 technology breakthrough but I think the big big breakthrough is to be able to show it hey maybe most of let's say
00:51:50 military planning or most of business strategy will actually be done strategically using computational game
00:51:55 theory that that's what I would like to see as a next five or ten year goal maybe you can explain to me again
00:52:01 forgive me if this is an obvious question but you know machine learning methods neural networks are suffer from
00:52:08 not being transparent not being explainable a game theoretic methods you know Nash equilibria do they generally
00:52:15 when you see the different solutions are they when you talk about military operations are they once you see the
00:52:23 strategies do they make sense that they explainable or do they suffer from the same problems as neural networks do so
00:52:29 that's that's a good question I would say a little bit yes and no and what I mean by that is that these games are
00:52:37 ethic strategies let's say Nash equilibrium it has provable properties so it's unlike let's say deep learning
00:52:44 where you kind of cross your fingers hopefully it'll work and then after the fact when you have the weights you're
00:52:49 still crossing your fingers and I hope it will work here you know that the solution quality is there this provable
00:52:58 or Souls from quality guarantees now that doesn't necessarily mean that the strategies are human understandable
00:53:05 that's a whole other problem so that's also I think it deep learning and computational game theory are in the
00:53:11 same boat in that sense that both are difficult to understand but at least the game theoretic techniques they have this
00:53:20 guarantees of guarantee quality so did you see business operations to achieve your corporations or even military in
00:53:27 the future being at least the strong candidates being proposed by automated systems do you see that yeah I do I do
00:53:36 but that's more of a really belief than a substantiated fact depending on where you land and optimism or pessimism
00:53:44 that's a relief to me that's an exciting future especially if they're provable things in terms of optimality so looking into
00:53:56 the future there's a a few folks worried about the especially you look at the game of poker which is probably one of
00:54:04 the last benchmarks in terms of games being solved they they worry about the future and the existential threats of
00:54:11 artificial intelligence so the negative impact in whatever form on society is that something that concerns you as much
00:54:19 are you more optimistic about the positive impacts of AI oh I am much more optimistic about the positive impacts so
00:54:26 just in my own work what we've done so far we run the nationwide kidney exchange hundreds of people are walking
00:54:33 around alive today who would it be and it's increased employment you had you have a lot of people now running kidney
00:54:41 changes and at the transplant centers interacting with the kidney exchange you have extra surgeons nurses
00:54:50 anesthesiologists hospitals all of that as so so employment is increasing from that and the world is becoming a better place
00:54:57 another example is combinatorial sourcing auctions we did 800 large-scale combinatorial sourcing auctions from
00:55:07 2001 to 2010 in a previous startup of mine called combine it and we increased the supply chain efficiency on that
00:55:15 sixty billion dollars of spend by twelve point six percent so that's over six billion dollars of efficiency
00:55:22 improvement in the world and this is also like shifting value from somebody to somebody else just efficiency
00:55:28 improvement like in trucking less empty driving so there's less waste less carbon footprint and so on it's a huge
00:55:37 positive impact in the near term but sort of to stay in it for a little longer because I think game theory is a
00:55:43 role to play here well let me actually come back and tell you this is one thing I think Asia is also going to make the
00:55:51 world much safer so so so that's another aspect that often gets overlooked well let me ask this question maybe you can
00:55:57 speak to the the safer so I talked to max tegmark is do a Russell who are very concerned about
00:56:03 the resume yeah and often the concern is about value misalignment so AI systems basically working operating towards
00:56:15 goals that are not the same as human civilization human beings so it seems like game theory has a role to play
00:56:25 there to to make sure the values are aligned with human beings I don't know if that's how you think about it if not
00:56:34 how do you think AI might help with this problem how do you think a i'ma make the world safer yeah I think this value
00:56:44 misalignment is a fairly theoretical worry and I haven't really seen it in it because I do a lot of real applications
00:56:53 I don't see it anywhere the closest I've seen it was the following type of mental exercise really
00:57:00 where I had this argument in the late 80s when we were building these transportation optimization systems and
00:57:05 somebody had heard that it's a good idea to have high utilization of assets so they told me that hey why don't you put
00:57:12 that as objective and we didn't even pull it as an objective because I just showed him it you know if you had that
00:57:19 as your objective the solution would be to load your trucks full and driving circles nothing would ever get delivered
00:57:24 you'd have a hundred percent utilization so yeah I know this phenomenon I've known this for over 30 years in but I've
00:57:31 never seen it actually be a problem reality in reality and yes if you have the wrong objective the AI will optimize
00:57:39 that to the hilt and it's gonna fit more than some human who's kind of trying to so within a half-baked way with some
00:57:47 human insight to but I just haven't seen that materialize in practice there's this gap that you actually put your
00:57:55 finger on very clearly just now between theory and reality that's very difficult to put into words I think it's what you
00:58:03 can theoretically imagine the worst possible case or even yeah I mean bad cases and what usually happens in
00:58:12 reality so for example to me maybe it's something you can comment on having grown up and I had grew up in the
00:58:19 Soviet Union you know there's currently 10,000 nuclear weapons in the world and for many decades it's theoretically
00:58:29 surprising to me that the nuclear war is not broken out do you think about this aspect from a game theoretic perspective
00:58:39 in general why is that true why in theory you could see how things would go terribly wrong and somehow yet they have
00:58:46 not yeah how do you think so so I do think that about that a lot I think the biggest two threats that we're facing as
00:58:52 mankind one is climate change and the other is nuclear war so I saw so those are my main two worries that they're
00:58:58 worried about and I've tried to do something about climate I thought about trying to do something for climate
00:59:04 change twice actually before two of my startups had actually commissioned studies of what we could do on those
00:59:10 things and we didn't really find a sweet spot but I'm still keeping an eye out on that if there's something where we could
00:59:16 actually provide a market solution or optimization solution or some other technology solution to problems right now
00:59:24 like for example pollution critic markets was what we were looking at then and it was much more the lack of
00:59:31 political will by those markets were not so successful rather than bad market design so I could go in and make a
00:59:37 better market design but that wouldn't really move the needle on the world very much if there's no political will and in
00:59:44 the u.s. you know the market at least the Chicago market was just shut down and and so on so it and then it doesn't
00:59:50 really help create your market design was there any nuclear side it's more so problem you know nuclear weapons have
01:00:04 been here it's an obvious problem has just been sitting there so how do you think about what is the mechanism design
01:00:11 there that just made everything seem stable and are you still extremely worried I am still extremely worried so
01:00:19 you probably know the simple game theory of mad so solar so this was a mutually assured destruction and it's like it
01:00:26 doesn't require any computation with small matrices you can actually convince yourself that the game is such that
01:00:32 nobody wants to initiate yeah that's a very coarse-grained analysis and it really works in a situation where you
01:00:39 have two superpowers or small number of superpowers now things are very different you have a smaller nuke so the
01:00:47 threshold of initiating is smaller and you have smaller countries and non non nation actors who make it Nokes and so
01:00:55 on so it's I think it's riskier now than it was maybe ever before and what idea application by I you've talked about a
01:01:06 little bit but what is the most exciting to you right now I mean you you're here at nips europe's
01:01:14 now you have a few excellent pieces of work but what are you thinking into the future with several companies you're
01:01:19 doing what's the most exciting thing or one of the exciting things the number one thing but for me right now is coming
01:01:26 up with these scalable techniques for game solving and applying them into the real world they're still very interested
01:01:33 in market design as well and we're doing that in the optimized markets but I'm most interested if number one right now
01:01:40 is strategic machine strategy robots getting that technology out there and seeing as you were in the trenches doing
01:01:46 applications what needs to be actually filled what technology gap still need to be filled so it's so hard to just put
01:01:52 your feet on the table and imagine what needs to be done but when you're actually doing real applications the
01:01:58 applications tell you what needs to be done and I really enjoy that interaction is it a challenging process to apply
01:02:06 some of the stay the are techniques you're working on and and having the the various players in industry or the
01:02:16 military or people who could really benefit from it actually use it what's that process like of you know in
01:02:22 autonomous vehicles will work with automotive companies and they're in in many ways they're a little bit
01:02:29 old-fashioned it's difficult they really want to use this technology there's clearly will have a significant benefit
01:02:37 but the systems aren't quite in place to easily have them integrated in terms of data in terms of compute in terms of all
01:02:45 these kinds of things so deuce is that one of the bigger challenges that you're facing and how do you tackle that
01:02:51 challenge yeah I think that's always a challenge that that's gonna slowness and inertia really of let's do things the
01:02:58 way we've always done it you just have to find the internal champions that the customer who understand that hey things
01:03:04 can't be the same way in the future otherwise bad things are going to happen and it's in order most vehicles it's
01:03:10 actually very interesting that the car makers are doing that then they're very traditional but at the same time you
01:03:14 have tech companies who have nothing to do with cars or transportation like Google and Baidu really pushing on
01:03:22 autonomous cars I find it fascinating clearly you're super excited about actually these ideas having an impact in
01:03:30 the world in terms of the technology in terms of ideas and research their directions that you're also excited
01:03:39 about whether that's on the some of the approaches you talked about for the imperfect information games whether it's
01:03:44 applying deep learning just some of these problems is there something that you're excited in in the research side
01:03:50 of things yeah yeah lots of different things in the game solving so solving even bigger games games will you have
01:04:00 more hidden action of the play your actions as well poker is a game where really the chance actions are hidden or
01:04:07 some of them are hidden but the player the multiplayer games of various sorts collusion opponent exploitation all and
01:04:21 even longer games some games that basically go forever but they're not repeated so seek extensive phone games
01:04:28 that go forever whoa what what would that even look like how do you represent that how do you solve that what's an
01:04:34 example of a game like that or is this some of the stochastic games the imagine let's say business strategy so it's and
01:04:39 not just modeling like a particular interaction but thinking about the business from here to eternity
01:04:48 or I think or let's let's say military strategy so it's not like war is going to go away how do you think about
01:04:54 military strategy that's going to go forever how do you even model that how do you know whether a move was good that
01:05:05 you somebody made and and and so on so that that's kind of one direction I'm also very interested in learning much
01:05:12 more scalable techniques for integer programming so we had a nice email paper this summer on that for the first
01:05:19 automated algorithm configuration paper that has theoretical generalization guarantees so if I see these many
01:05:26 training examples and I told my algorithm in this way it's going to have good performance on the real
01:05:33 distribution which have not seen so which is kind of interesting that you know algorithm configuration has been
01:05:39 going on now for at least 17 years seriously and there has not been any generalization theory before well this
01:05:48 is really exciting and it's been it's a huge honor to talk to you thank you so much to us thank you for bringing
