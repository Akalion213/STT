00:00:20 such as discord access and maybe even a little behind the scenes content okay mrs bonaparte this is it one last
00:00:32 congratulations it's a general oh and here comes the rest of the army now history is full of great conquerors many
00:01:04 with very impressive origin stories for example alexander the great was the son of a king
00:01:09 julius caesar came from an aristocratic family that descended from a goddess great conquerors don't usually come from
00:01:15 relatively insignificant families living on impoverished islands but as it just so happens
00:01:21 that is where our story begins in the early 18th century the island of corsica was a part of the republic of genoa
00:01:27 until one day corsica said hey we're declaring independence and it's probably not worth your time to try and stop us
00:01:32 so genoa said you're right it isn't worth their time hey friends you want to buy this island
00:01:37 and france said sure thing and thus corsica became france just in time for napoleon to be born
00:01:43 french many corsicans didn't appreciate their new conquerors however and from an early age napoleon developed
00:01:48 some fairly anti-french sentiments napoleon's dad however quickly embraced his new french overlords which created
00:01:55 some tension between dad and son look at me i'm dad i wear powdered wigs and silver buckle shoes and i'm a
00:02:00 traitor to the corsican people go to your room napoleon no you go to your room dad
00:02:06 okay on the other hand napoleon adored his mother who was definitely the disciplinarian of the family and even
00:02:10 though she would punish napoleon severely he kind of respected that but napoleon's parents wanted the best for their family
00:02:16 and since they were a very minor nobility they were able to have napoleon sent off to the shining lights and rat
00:02:21 infested sewage puddles of the big city napoleon went to military school in france okay napoleon why don't you introduce
00:02:28 yourself to your new classmates well i'm napoleon and i hate all of you your farts smell like cheese you can't
00:02:33 pronounce the letter r all you do is go on strike and you call eggs oops like a bunch of big dumb idiot dingleberries
00:02:43 okay thanks napoleon i hope you like being bullied and bullied he was they picked on him for his
00:02:48 corsican accent his family's lack of wealth and it probably didn't help that he also had a bit of a chip on his shoulder but
00:02:54 he could hold his own and on an average day might be found dishing out ratatouille sandwiches for breakfast he spent much
00:02:59 of his time alone and he loved reading about the great conquerors of history he learned about
00:03:04 julius caesar and he wondered if one day he too might have a pizza franchise named after him
00:03:12 he excelled at math and geography and when he graduated at the age of 16 he was made second lieutenant in an
00:03:17 artillery regiment now second lieutenant might sound pretty sweet to a screw-up like you
00:03:22 but napoleon had a little something called ambition stonks of it and he wasn't content being
00:03:28 just some junior officer he wanted to rise the ranks unfortunately for him
00:03:33 that would be a little difficult well napoleon i've reviewed your application it's clear you're very skilled and would
00:03:39 be a perfect fit for the promotion and simeon you're just about the biggest idiot i've ever seen your test results
00:03:44 suggest you have the mental aptitude of a senile earthworm and in the part of the form where you list your experience
00:03:48 you seem to have drawn a picture of a gerbil giving birth to a shoe but your dad is the marquis de la fu fayette so
00:03:56 you get the job french society was just too closed off positions were handed out based on nobility
00:04:02 not talent and the young napoleon probably felt stuck wouldn't it be nice if say a revolution
00:04:08 came along and changed all of that well what are the chances
00:04:14 the french revolution is here best deal toppling head shopping king popping the revolution promised to
00:04:19 do away with the old social hierarchy and make everyone a little more equal napoleon may not have cared much for the
00:04:25 violent mobs but if it meant he could rise the ranks he was in he began fighting to defend
00:04:31 the revolution he put down a british-sponsored counter-revolution in toulon and got promoted he put down a royalist
00:04:36 uprising in paris and got promoted and as his military prowess became more recognized he was
00:04:41 even given his very own army it was astonishing progress for such a young man of humble origins
00:04:47 and napoleon's wildest dreams were coming true but napoleon also believed he could
00:04:52 increase his social status if he married an older rich lady and so around this time napoleon went on the prowl however if
00:04:59 some sources are to be believed he was a verified creep he reportedly had terrible luck with woman
00:05:05 and most wanted nothing to do with him fortunately he eventually met josephine an aging single mother who was
00:05:10 deeply in debt and needed stability so she agreed to marry him despite finding him intensely disgusting
00:05:17 napoleon you dirty dog you've done it unbeknownst to napoleon however josephine had a bit of a promiscuous
00:05:23 reputation hey napoleon i hear you're marrying josephine boy she sure is a great kisser that's
00:05:28 right hey wait what do you mean she's a great kisser hey hugo you hear napoleon's marrying josephine
00:05:33 wow she sure is a great kisser now hang on just a minute hey everyone napoleon's marrying josephine oh yeah
00:05:40 yeah sure is a great kid i'm pretty sure i kissed you just yesterday sake is there anyone here who
00:05:45 hasn't kissed my wife as napoleon fell madly in love with his new wife she fell
00:05:54 madly in love with a man named hippolyte it wouldn't be long however before napoleon would leave home and go
00:05:59 to war because while france was having its revolution tensions in europe were rising hey
00:06:05 austria you'll never guess what we just did what's that friends i got two words for you revo
00:06:11 lucian we totally just socked it to our monarchy what dude the rest of us are monarchies you've just totally threatened the
00:06:19 balance of power in europe now we have to worry about our stinky peasants rising up against us
00:06:23 i mean holy hell your queen is okay friends this is pretty awkward
00:06:29 and the rest of europe is probably itching to give you a wedgie but you're not ready for a war yet
00:06:35 so you gotta be cool man it's absolutely crucial that you say something to defuse the situation right now
00:06:48 so france ended up at war with basically the rest of europe and the war of the first coalition began
00:06:54 at first france struggled but then they started to do surprisingly well and in many conquered territories they
00:06:59 began to establish sister republics exporting their revolutionary ideas across europe
00:07:05 in 1796 they planned a three-pronged attack to take vienna and knock austria out of the war with two magnificent
00:07:10 armies in the north to kick ass and napoleon in the south has a bit of a diversion for the first time
00:07:16 napoleon would lead a military campaign this was his chance to prove himself to be somebody and what
00:07:22 a general he proved to be the army he was given were demoralized lacking equipment and underpaid but
00:07:28 napoleon galvanized them with inspirational speeches and he took them into italy he was
00:07:33 outnumbered and his campaign was partially meant to be a sideshow but he made it the main show while the
00:07:38 two northern armies were being held back napoleon made staggering progress in a signature napoleon move
00:07:45 he masterfully split his enemies into two and took them on separately knocking sardinia out of the
00:07:49 war and putting the austrians on the run at the famous battle of lodi he was in the fray
00:07:54 aiming the cannons himself getting covered in mud and earning the total respect of his men they respected him so much
00:08:00 that when he ordered an almost suicidal assault on the only bridge in town his men threw themselves at it and took it
00:08:06 despite fierce austrian resistance for napoleon it was all he needed to confirm that he was the greatest human
00:08:13 who had ever existed wow napoleon you're pretty great at this military stuff just be careful your head doesn't get
00:08:17 too big what did you just say to me a little prick and as napoleon swept through northern italy the italians
00:08:24 cheered his arrival yes i'm here to liberate you from your cruel and replace them with french ones
00:08:35 napoleon plundered as he went sending riches back to france to help its economy but also paying his men the
00:08:40 first real money they'd seen in years the pope had been supporting the austrians so napoleon
00:08:45 briefly went to go give him a slap and as he began to approach vienna the exhausted austrians were forced to
00:08:51 make peace with napoleon overseeing negotiations himself he had just single-handedly knocked
00:08:55 austria out of the war and by the way he was only 28 so maybe it's about time you moved out of your
00:09:00 dad's attic in the italian territories he had conquered napoleon established new
00:09:05 french sister republics even writing constitutions and organizing governments himself
00:09:10 not something a general generally does when he got back to france he was hailed as a hero and the extremely unpopular
00:09:16 government were concerned he might get some power-hungry ideas so they agreed he should go far away
00:09:21 from france to egypt where he could maybe undermine british access to india napoleon was eager to win more glory so
00:09:27 he brought with him a team of scholars and he was like whoa it's a freaky man cat whoa it's a big stick
00:09:33 well it's an ugly horse whoa it's a stumpy little manlet hey i'm actually average height for the time
00:09:41 but then british admiral nelson came down and wrecked his fleet and an anglo-ottoman force defeated him at acre
00:09:47 so napoleon abandoned his men and went back to france his campaign in egypt hadn't gone quite
00:09:52 as planned but one thing you should know about napoleon was that he was a skilled propagandist he published his own newspapers that
00:09:59 sometimes exaggerated his achievements and even commissioned paintings that generally made him look cool so when he
00:10:04 returned to paris he was yet again hailed as a hero and he began to get some power hungry ideas
00:10:10 first however he had a bit of a problem to deal with see he had learned something shocking
00:10:15 about his dear wife really josephine this guy i'm just as tall as him i'm sorry i swear now that you're becoming famous
00:10:23 i'll never do it again make sure you don't i've never stooped so louis to cheat on you
00:10:29 now if you'll excuse me i'll be in this room consulting my generals for the next 30 minutes and by consulting i mean
00:10:35 boinking by my generals i mean this woman and by 30 minutes i mean two seconds having dealt with his
00:10:44 wife napoleon was then approached by a very influential politician who said he had an idea he wanted to stage a coup
00:10:49 against the deeply unpopular government and needed the extremely popular napoleon's help and napoleon thought
00:10:55 that was just the darn tootiness idea the plan was to trap the government and convince him to voluntarily give up
00:10:59 their power and here's how they did it hey guys oh my gosh
00:11:04 quick there's a dangerous jacobin plot to overthrow you which we definitely aren't just making up
00:11:08 better get inside this cage so we can protect you okay gentlemen
00:11:17 we got him in this case the cage was an isolated palace outside of paris with no one around but napoleon
00:11:24 and his army with the government inside napoleon then entered and a pretty chaotic event ensued during which the
00:11:28 government didn't seem entirely sure what was going on napoleon's men didn't seem entirely sure
00:11:33 what was going on and napoleon himself didn't seem entirely sure what was going on but thankfully napoleon's brother lucian
00:11:39 president of the lower house managed to regain control and the remaining councilmen were intimidated
00:11:44 into creating a new constitution and thus a new government was formed this time with three consuls in charge but after
00:11:49 napoleon did some rewriting in the end there was really only one man in charge the first
00:11:55 consul him and over the next few years he worked to consolidate even more power and essentially became a dictator
00:12:02 in total control of france by the way he was only 30. so maybe it's about time you washed your
00:12:06 disgusting bed sheets france was now ruled by possibly the greatest military leader of the time possibly the greatest or definitely
00:12:15 well now is his chance to prove it see back when napoleon was still in egypt being indiana jones
00:12:21 back home france was in france being france they had conquered even more territory and they were like
00:12:26 hey piedmont you get revolutionary ideals hey switzerland you get revolutionary ideals and rome
00:12:33 you get revolutionary ideals everybody gets revolutionary oh hey guys nice sledgehammers and
00:12:39 naples very cool nail gun you guys here to get some revolutionary ideas as france was still spreading the
00:12:48 revolution and with napoleon busy in egypt the european powers felt the time was right for round two
00:12:53 and the war of the second coalition began and this time their big bad boy buddy russia was here
00:12:59 to bang some french boys back to bordeaux and bang him they did france got blasted but then russia pulled out after
00:13:06 stalling in switzerland and now that napoleon was in charge of the country he was ready to start blasting right back
00:13:12 he took command of the army of the reserve and he brought the fight to the austrians now there are many traits that made
00:13:18 napoleon a great military leader i already mentioned one of them how he was one of the boys and commanded the
00:13:23 total loyalty of his men but now we see a second reason the element of surprise
00:13:29 in 1800 napoleon moved to geneva and it looked like he was probably going to take on the austrian forces in germany
00:13:35 there's no way he'd be crazy enough to move his entire army south to the alps as a surprise attack on the austrians
00:13:38 besieging genoa oh napoleon's moving his entire army south through the alps as a surprise
00:13:44 attack on the austrians besieging genoa napoleon's crossing of the alps is legendary and you may have seen one of
00:13:49 the most famous paintings of the general popping a sick wheelie on his majestic stallion surrounded by dangerous
00:13:53 mountain terrain of course in real life he made the crossing on a depressed mule
00:13:58 but that's not as cool when he emerged in italy the austrians expected him to come break their siege
00:14:03 but napoleon went for their supply line near milan forcing the austrians to meet napoleon head-on at the famous battle of moringa
00:14:09 the austrians initially clobbered the outnumbered french and they were like hooray we won but then a few hours later
00:14:15 napoleon showed up again with an even bigger army and he clobbered them right back holy cow this tiny little fun-sized
00:14:21 french guy is running rings around us all right i'm average height for the time you jerk
00:14:26 then after general morrow's victory at hohen linden vienna was exposed and the austrians again sued for peace
00:14:33 just like the war of the first coalition the second coalition ended in another french victory but in many ways they
00:14:37 both felt more like napoleon victories only the uk remained at war with napoleon
00:14:43 and they were using their powerful navy to blockade french ports and were even seizing the cargos of neutral ships
00:14:49 obviously everyone else got pretty pissed off that the british were interfering with their trade so in response
00:14:54 they formed a league and they embargoed the uk right back neutral countries protecting their own
00:15:00 interests that's offensive so britain went to copenhagen and blew a bunch of stuff up and the league disbanded but because
00:15:06 the uk's economy was pretty bust they decided to sign a treaty with france in 1802 for the first time
00:15:13 in a long time europe was at peace congratulations sire you've achieved peace yes pierre but not for long

00:16:29 you'll be supporting my channel so thank you now where were we oh yeah crossing the alps defeating the austrians and europe at
00:16:40 peace what a meteoric rise it had been for the young corsican he had just taken charge of a nation
00:16:45 that appeared to be losing a war and turned it all around securing french gains in europe
00:16:51 but there was now a big question you see throughout the chaotic french revolution french governments had struggled to keep
00:16:57 the economy afloat they often didn't have a whole lot of support and they frequently came and went
00:17:02 would napoleon finally be the man who could stick around military victories were one thing but
00:17:07 could the general also govern spoiler alert yes the economy is crumbling well then why don't you have
00:17:13 yourself a new national bank currency reform and improve taxation and welfare systems the legal system is an incoherent mess
00:17:19 well then why don't we nicely wrap all those civil laws up into one new centralized legal code corrupt government officials
00:17:25 throw them in the trash bad infrastructure throw it in the trash woman's rights
00:17:31 throw him in the trash wait really well yeah unfortunately while napoleon was building on the
00:17:35 equality of the revolution he also largely scaled back rights for certain groups and husbands had full legal control over
00:17:40 their wives but come on ladies maybe let men have a slice of the pie for once
00:17:46 okay napoleon further reformed education ensuring a system based on individual ability meaning now simeon had to compete with
00:17:53 everyone else and napoleon could get the cream of the crop to help him run the republic but he wasn't just building on the ideas
00:17:59 of the revolution the revolution had led to a lot of chaos and napoleon needed stability so he rolled back a
00:18:05 couple things most notably with religion the revolution had pretty much kicked the catholic church to the
00:18:10 curb but napoleon understood that since many french citizens still considered themselves catholic
00:18:15 that could be a problem so he came to an agreement with the pope and brought back the church
00:18:19 only this time with some pretty hefty power limitations he also ensured freedom for other religions
00:18:24 and is often noted for his positive treatment of jewish people at a time of widespread anti-semitism
00:18:28 but while all of this may make napoleon sound like a pretty stand-up dude it's good to note that he believed in
00:18:33 religious freedom because he thought it was a powerful tool to keep the poor from eating the rich
00:18:38 or something like that overall napoleon's aim was to end the chaos of the revolution
00:18:42 and finally create a stable and prospering french republic and in that aim he seemed to be largely
00:18:47 successful and generally popular with the people of france he officially declared that the
00:18:52 revolution is over adding i am the revolution napoleon's head could be seen for miles
00:18:58 of course not everyone was happy with napoleon's reforms conservatives felt he was too radical
00:19:04 radicals felt he was too conservative but since napoleon was a dictator opposition could usually be stamped out
00:19:09 with some good old-fashioned iron fisting in 1804 napoleon took one last major step after some failed attempts were made to
00:19:17 assassinate him he wanted to strengthen his position and ensure his dynasty could live on
00:19:21 after him and so he decided being first council for life simply wasn't quite enough he decided he
00:19:26 should become emperor he held a vote asking the french people if they were cool with the idea
00:19:32 and they returned a definitely not rigged 99.9 in favor the balls on this man and so on the 2nd of
00:19:39 december 1804 in an elaborate ceremony at notre dame napoleon was made
00:19:45 emperor the pope was even invited to attend and normally he would crown an emperor but to make
00:19:49 sure everyone knew this wasn't some charlemagne style circular power division napoleon lifted the crown and placed it
00:19:55 on his own head like i said the balls on this man he was now emperor of the french well napoleon you
00:20:02 were a general then he became first consul for life and now you're an emperor
00:20:08 is it enough yet is your ambition finally satisfied i don't know pierre what comes after
00:20:13 emperor i would say god sire you want to be a god yes i'll put it down under maybe
00:20:26 okay everyone what the hell is going on this core skin guy showed up out of nowhere and he's kicking our ass
00:20:31 he's exporting the ideas of the french revolution wherever he goes and he just declared himself king of
00:20:37 italy and emperor he can't do that i'm the emperor oh hey fellow monarchs i see you're having a monarch party
00:20:43 my invite must have got lost in the mail i'll just set up a spot right here wow
00:20:50 you don't belong here napoleon we're coming to take you down i'd like to see you try i'm so scared i
00:20:56 just pooed my pants no but i did just poo my pants before napoleon had even declared himself
00:21:11 emperor the british had already redeclared war on france because both sides had been violating their previous treaty
00:21:17 napoleon immediately occupied hanover and then began making plans for a great british invasion partially paid for by
00:21:22 selling a huge chunk of land to the united states napoleon gathered his army along the
00:21:27 english channel but here was the problem while napoleon's powerful army would almost certainly
00:21:32 obliterate the british on land there was very little chance he'd actually make it across the channel
00:21:38 because britannia ruled the waves this power dynamic would keep the two traditional enemies from engaging in
00:21:43 much real direct combat throughout the napoleonic wars however the british had something else
00:21:47 up their sleeve copious amounts of money they were willing to throw cash at anyone who
00:21:53 would go to war against napoleon and there were plenty of takers austria russia naples and sweden hoping
00:21:59 to put napoleon's france back in its place formed the third coalition against france the coalition forces probably
00:22:05 thought that this time they stood a chance they weren't prepared for the total humiliation
00:22:11 they were about to suffer the war of the third coalition was napoleon at his best we've already learned two ways in which
00:22:17 napoleon was a great military commander but here comes one of the biggest reasons speed he had reorganized his army into
00:22:23 cores which were themselves basically small armies each had their own infantry cavalry
00:22:29 and artillery and as a result was able to act more independently they spread out through the countryside
00:22:34 and by living off the land rather than relying on heavy supply trains they were able to move extremely quickly
00:22:40 napoleon would traverse massive distances outmaneuver his enemies isolate them and then move in
00:22:46 for the kill before they even knew what was going on lightning warfare leading to total
00:22:51 destruction would you like to see him do it here we go part of the coalition's plan was for the russians to meet up with the
00:22:57 austrians and take on napoleon together combined they could turn the tide against him so napoleon
00:23:02 needed to stop them from ever meeting but he's all the way over in bologna no problem in a matter of weeks napoleon
00:23:08 marched 200 000 men in secret encircling austrian general mack and capturing his entire army
00:23:15 a devastating blow napoleon later remarked i have destroyed the austrian army by simply marching
00:23:20 next he turned to face the approaching russians okay it looks like the french are coming for us but check this out
00:23:26 i've got an amazing idea when they approach we run away sir you're a genius the russians began to
00:23:35 retreat with napoleon giving chase and since his tactics relied on quick victories this
00:23:39 could be a problem especially because the longer the war went on the more likely it looked other countries may
00:23:43 join the coalition against him but napoleon knew the russians are alexander the first
00:23:50 was young and seeking glory so he came up with an idea to lure him in he sent him a message what does it say um
00:23:58 it says hello i'm just a widdle baby boy and i'm very scared are you talking like that or is he he is sir
00:24:05 why is he doing that i don't know but it's very cute helpless and vulnerable a little baby boy eh
00:24:13 very scared eh cute hey boris get my crossbow we're going hunting the allied forces turned to face
00:24:20 napoleon who they now believed was in a vulnerable position he was set up at austerlitz and to make
00:24:25 it look like he was retreating he had even evacuated the high ground a thick fog set in obscuring napoleon's
00:24:31 center as the allies took the bait and set up on the heights from there they spotted napoleon's very weak
00:24:35 looking right flank and they descended the heights to go get it little did they know
00:24:41 it was exactly what napoleon was hoping they'd do the next thing they knew a large french force was emerging from the fog
00:24:47 launching a huge central assault up the hill they swung around crushing the allies and as men attempted
00:24:53 to flee across the frozen lakes napoleon ordered his artillery to fire on the ice causing an unknown number
00:25:00 to drown but he told me he was just a little baby boy what happened he tricked you sir you mean
00:25:07 i was the little baby boy all along it was napoleon's masterpiece and austria were once again forced to make
00:25:13 peace with france then with the french conquest of naples in 1806 the war of the third coalition
00:25:19 ended as yet another napoleon victory this was the third time napoleon had had to give austrian
00:25:25 emperor francis a good spanking and so with the peace treaty in 1805
00:25:31 napoleon was determined to punish him he was forced to give up territory hand over significant compensation
00:25:36 and promised never to fight napoleon again for now russia sweden and the uk remained at war
00:25:42 with france but none were able to offer much of a threat and so napoleon got to work
00:25:47 strengthening his grip over europe he gave out rule of captured territories to his family and friends
00:25:52 and most notably he established a new confederation in germany with himself as its protector seeing his influence in
00:25:58 germany being wiped away emperor francis acknowledged reality and officially dissolved the holy roman empire
00:26:05 an entity that had existed for over a thousand years but it wasn't all good news for napoleon
00:26:11 for one thing spain had earlier allied with france in 1804 because the british just couldn't help themselves from
00:26:15 blowing up spanish ships and napoleon hoped a combined french spanish fleet would eventually be able
00:26:20 to invade england unfortunately he received word that british admiral nelson had engaged his
00:26:25 fleet at trafalgar normally naval battles looked like this but in this case nelson
00:26:31 did this was it because he was an idiot no it's because he was a genius he successfully punched through the franco
00:26:36 spanish line and unleashed hell his victory ensured british control of the sea
00:26:43 and his death during the battle made him a legend napoleon's hopes for a future british
00:26:47 invasion were gone but not just that napoleon was also hoping to secure peace on the continent
00:26:52 but that wasn't looking likely because the prussian king was under pressure from his wife
00:26:57 frederick he's established a confederation in our turf and he told us he'd give us hannover but
00:27:02 then offered it to the british you have to declare war on him what is it with you and war what is it with you
00:27:08 and being a cupcake go to war okay in october 1806 prussia with its famed military tradition
00:27:15 joined the coalition and declared war beginning the war of the fourth coalition unfortunately prussian king frederick
00:27:21 william iii wasn't the smartest tool in the shed look at him over there being all french
00:27:25 makes me sick boys we'll get him this time but here's the thing
00:27:31 this time we have to stick together do not under any circumstances face napoleon by yourself
00:27:37 you all saw what happened to austria hey where'd fred go hey you jerk think you're some kind of
00:27:42 big shot huh wanna tangle with fred you don't got the cajones we're screwed without consulting its allies
00:27:47 prussia had gone ahead and sent napoleon an ultimatum demanding he move all his forces out of germany now some of you watching
00:27:53 this video probably can't even wipe your own bum bum yet but even you know you don't just send napoleon an
00:28:00 ultimatum obviously napoleon went in for the kill prussia's army was quite outdated so
00:28:04 when they met napoleon at the twin battles of yena and oursted it wasn't even close even
00:28:09 marshall davu's heavily outnumbered court aurstat sent the prussians running and napoleon
00:28:13 carried out a ruthless pursuit of his fleeing enemy taking berlin and within a single month
00:28:18 decimating the prussian forces frederick william and the remnants of his army moved to the east
00:28:23 at this point napoleon's forces were pretty tired winter had come and conditions were miserable he
00:28:29 anticipated both sides would settle into winter quarters but russia decided to try their hand at
00:28:34 an unexpected winter attack a series of brutal battles followed that took a heavy toll
00:28:39 on both sides including the vicious battle of ayla fought in blizzard conditions men froze to death and many deserted the
00:28:46 russian artillery tore the french to shreds and napoleon himself was momentarily under risk of
00:28:51 being captured in the end the french army was saved thanks to a legendary cavalry charge by
00:28:56 napoleon's flamboyant cavalry commander miura after the horror inflicted on both sides they decided it might be a good idea not
00:29:03 to do any more fighting until after winter then after winter came and the fighting continued the russians were pushed back
00:29:09 to friedland where russian general bennigsen made a bit of a blunder by positioning himself with the aloe river
00:29:13 to his back the french artillery were able to pin the russians between the river and their
00:29:18 concentrated gunfire a major element in napoleon's fighting style and many russians drowned
