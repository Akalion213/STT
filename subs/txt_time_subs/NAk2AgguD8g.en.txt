00:00:02 a girl bought an abandoned island in the ocean for fifteen thousand dollars and made something
00:00:06 incredible on it hello friends who among us has not dreamed of our own island in the
00:00:17 beautiful azir waters where you can meet sunrises and sunsets every day
00:00:21 listen to the singing of the birds and the sound of waves look at the endless white beaches enjoying the aroma of the
00:00:26 sea air well of course many will say that such fantasies are only for the rich
00:00:32 for those who have at least a couple million dollars in their accounts but what if i was to tell you that to
00:00:37 become the owner of a private island you don't need a big fortune on the contrary the most ordinary housewife can
00:00:43 become a millionaire having one spot a small island for almost free
00:00:47 don't believe me then you should definitely hear this story australian melito hunter until 2005 was
00:00:54 the most ordinary housewife who only dealt with household issues and went shopping from morning until late at night
00:01:01 and by the way she didn't even think about creating something with her own hands back then
00:01:07 but only one case changed everything in early 2005 molito's husband became unemployed
00:01:12 several months in search of a job did not lead to a result and already disappointed the family was
00:01:17 ready for the worst this continued for some time until the end of 2005.
00:01:23 molito's husband was invited to work in cambodia naturally moving from developed australia to a not so rich country in asia
00:01:30 was a real challenge for the family but since there were no other options the spouse was forced to agree and of
00:01:36 course his wife went to southeast asia with him as melito recalled we were not at all
00:01:41 delighted with this trip and therefore we agree that we initially planned to stay in cambodia for a year
00:01:47 and then after saving some money we would leave for a noisy but well-developed and
00:01:51 understandable to a civilized person new york arriving in cambodia the young couple was confused for some
00:01:58 time all this seemed alien to them and even a little scary but since we have already accepted the challenge
00:02:03 it means we need to spend all this time with benefit said melita later every weekend the couple traveled and
00:02:09 got to know this country more and more and to their surprise everything turned out to be not so bad
00:02:15 incredibly beautiful nature friendly and helpful people and of course the beaches that are washed by waters of
00:02:20 the gulf of thailand so once again going on a weekend to the southwest of the country
00:02:26 namely to the korang archipelago the girl's attention was drawn to a small island called sangsa
00:02:31 but the fact is that a small piece of land was in a terrible state deforestation fishing and garbage thrown ashore
00:02:38 all this created a depressing picture i remember then i asked our guide why it was so dirty
00:02:43 here to which i heard the answer that the island is nobody's business and no one cares about it he also added
00:02:49 as a joke with a smile on his face that it is for sale and if you want it you can buy it for yourself and put things
00:02:54 in order so the words of the guide who didn't even think about it twice
00:02:59 became a turning point in the lives of our couple the very next day they decided to find out how much the
00:03:04 abandoned island costs and were surprised by what they heard local authorities were ready to sell it
00:03:09 for only fifteen thousand dollars but with one condition the buyer must put it in order
00:03:15 and that would cost a lot this is how the family acquired their island in 2005 to bring its natural beauty back
00:03:21 for some time the island remained untouched but two years later alito received a loan from the state at
00:03:26 a low interest rate and work began working on the island by the way friends
00:03:31 15 years have passed since then and hunter still lives on the shores of the gulf of thailand
00:03:36 with her husband and two adopted children though their quality of life has changed
00:03:40 has changed for the better the money received from the state was enough to restore the island
00:03:45 and in 2008 a private resort was built on top of it today a paradise called song sa resort
00:03:50 is a khmer restaurant bar spa services and of course stunning and untouched nature in 2012 the island
00:03:57 received an award from the cambodian government as a pioneer in luxury tourism based on the conservation of natural resources
00:04:04 in cooperation with the cambodian government and other investors the island was completely rebuilt in the
00:04:10 same year the resort's style draws inspiration from cambodian fishing villages throughout the koh rang archipelago all
00:04:16 27 villas have indoor and outdoor showers and a private pool saving nature is also a major theme on
00:04:23 the private island of sangsa and guests can visit the resort's life center to learn about the local environment
00:04:29 and the work being done to protect it there are tours available for adults and children allowing them to see how coral is grown
00:04:35 get to know the local mangrove forests or visit some of the projects the resort started in the local village
00:04:40 where they set up a waste management system and agricultural projects the island is only a few
00:04:45 kilometers area-wise but there are mangrove forests remote beaches and tropical jungles
00:04:51 and the cost per day of stay on the island is approximately 900 maybe some will say that it's a lot but
00:04:57 as it shows there are no problems with attracting tourists all real estate on the island
00:05:04 is made of natural or recycled materials wood or stone and in some cases even the remains of old boats
00:05:10 you will also not be offered coca-cola hamburgers sausages and other similar dishes only local and healthy
00:05:18 in 2014 molito launched a new project in which a villa on the island can now not only be rented but also bought
00:05:23 though the price tag is far from small from 900 000 to 2 million dollars for a hot
00:05:29 but there were a lot of people willing to buy it it is also worth noting that the residents were immediately delighted
00:05:35 with the australian woman's activities because cambodia has problems with employment and at the moment
00:05:41 more than 200 residents from other islands in nearby villages are employees of the wonderful resort
00:05:46 however this was not what made the girl a local hero it was the fact that in addition to
00:05:51 maintaining the resort melito is actively engaged in charity and very different kinds of it
00:05:56 melito spends some of the profits on the education of local children she builds schools and employs teachers
00:06:02 she also supports environmental and other initiatives in cambodia all this made a simple former housewife
00:06:07 a real hero for a once unfamiliar and foreign country the resort has received a huge
00:06:12 number of awards among which there are world famous ones which are given only to the best
00:06:17 you can get to the little island paradise by boat from cehanukville which is located less than 30 kilometers
00:06:24 from the island or by helicopter from pompen molito herself along with her husband and children
00:06:30 has lived on the island for more than 15 years and does not want to leave as the woman says now this is our home
00:06:36 we are accustomed to this place and want to make it even better we do not need big money
00:06:42 all we need we already have and that is fresh air snow white beaches and crystal clear water and of course
00:06:47 the smiles of residents who simply idolize melito for all that she has done for them
00:06:52 it so happened that an absurd combination of circumstances difficulties and a lack of work for her
00:06:58 husband made the modest housewife the queen of a magnificent resort that is incredibly successful
00:07:04 here is such a story friends which once again shows all of us that after the black stripe there should
00:07:08 always be a white one and everything that happens is for the best the main thing
00:07:14 is just to consider the prospects how do you feel about the whole idea of a resort on an abandoned island
