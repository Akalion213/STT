00:00:03 i have done leg extensions every single day for the past six days six days i've done leg extensions
00:00:12 initially i was going kind of heavy then light and heavy than light to kind of like you know volume one day and then
00:00:16 i would push a heavier set of weights the next day pretty much the last three days i've
00:00:23 just done heavy you know i look back at the the training log what i've been writing down
00:00:29 all of them heavy and every single time i've been able to recover like like i didn't do anything
00:00:35 so yesterday like you know i pushed really hard and i was expecting oh my god here we go i'm going to be saw today
00:00:42 nothing as you can see here today i decided to do single leg  extensions um
00:00:49 i'll swear to you tomorrow i'm gonna be you know perfectly fine as well i'm not gonna be sore this is like
00:00:54 literally the the cheapest freaking exercise i've come across i've never done an exercise every single day to this many
00:01:00 reps this much volume and not feel anything you know i don't know what it is i know some of you
00:01:05 guys are thinking but you've been squatting every single day for the last 50 million years
00:01:09 i have man but i've seen like i've order regulated i've never done like big squats back to back to back you know
00:01:15 i'm doing like hundreds of reps with this man like i'm doing sets of 30 sets of 20 for like 10 sets man
00:01:23 and you know i'd get pumped pump pump quads you know i'd feel them that afternoon that night or whatever and then i wake
00:01:30 up the following morning like nothing maybe the first to the second day i felt something like the mildest of mildest
00:01:37  dorms but nothing so you know on one end i've got the the you know deadlifts  it's it's
00:01:41 now today is day five i think since the last time i did them
00:01:46 and i feel pretty good today but you know it's taking me five days to wash away that fatigue from a single damn rep
00:01:51 of deadlifts yeah okay it was a one rep max the okay was a it was a you know
00:01:57 very kind of slow lift you know meaning heaps of time under tension five days to recover from that and
00:02:04 this thing is literally i feel like 12 hours 12 hours and i'm good to go again it's phenomenal and it's really good
00:02:10 in my case because that's exactly what i need to do to bring up this weakness that i have
00:02:15 and you know i've been actually thinking last few days that this is actually the source of my
00:02:21  hip pain i know i've kind of been beating around the bush like anybody's business you know hamstring
00:02:28 quad whatever i don't even know what it is but my hips have been feeling really good
00:02:32 since i've done this amount of  leg extensions like heaps and hips and heaps and volume
00:02:38 they say i've got some more internal rotation they hit because of this as well you'll see when i get to the squats for
00:02:43 some reason today as i was squatting i just wanted to bring my feet in
00:02:50 even more and i wanted to point my my toes my toes forward ever since i've started
00:02:54 doing these leg extensions so today i decided let let them let the toes go wherever they want
00:03:01 let the hips go wherever they want and now i'm like squatting super narrow you know super into my quads
00:03:08 i feel comfortable there's no hip pain i feel really stacked at the bottom position man like this is the thing like
00:03:13 a lot of you guys have said you know you know space out your your stance you'll be able to sit further down
00:03:19 in between your legs i feel like when i do that i'm kind of collapsing in there's
00:03:23 nothing to support me underneath you know what i mean like you're sitting in between your legs and then you have to
00:03:26 kind of like save yourself from that well you know you're kind of dumping into the well
00:03:31 but when i have my feet really close together like you'll see in this video super freaking narrow stance i feel like
00:03:37 i'm sitting on top of my ankles i'm sitting on my car so i'm sitting on something that's going to push me back up
00:03:43 it's like a more stacked position i can't really explain to you guys this is kind of the best i i i
00:03:48 can do i feel like i'm sitting on top of myself like a coil right like a you know car car spring you know everything like
00:03:55 stacked on top of each other whereas if that spring if you had a kind of sideways if you can
00:03:59 even imagine that it would have less rebound right because it's kind of falling away from itself
00:04:06 i'm falling on top of myself and i just feel like it's just so so much easier to get out of the bottom
00:04:10 position that way in fact when i see my kids squat you know natural squat is like every kid
00:04:16 you know gets born into this world you know my kids squat really narrow as well they're basically sitting on their ankles
00:04:22 and sometimes through our life at all life we just lose all our freaking hip internal rotation and we just
00:04:28 lose everything and we have to kind of you know do the louis simmons west side barbell boy squat but what
00:04:33 you need to understand with the squat like that is that those boys usually have gear right they have those
00:04:39 whatever you call them briefs or suits or whatever the hell it is so you know those suits and briefs rebound
00:04:45 out of that bottom position but if you're squatting sumo and you're raw i don't know what's
00:04:50 getting you out of that position man you know automatically you have to cut depth right you have to kind of cheat your way
00:04:55 through depth somehow get your theme is paralleled with the floor and then up you go but
00:04:59 there's no way you could squat atg that way right you would just freaking sit on your ass
00:05:07 so anyway really really interesting  the fact that i'm doing an exercise to volume and it's so cheap i love cheap things
00:05:14 man i love cheap food i love going to my local vietnamese joints and eating foe and all that stuff you pay
00:05:20 like nine dollars and you're laughing nine australian dollars by the way i don't know what that is in america it's
00:05:24 even cheaper put like six bucks or whatever some reason i've always loved that stuff like peasant food you know
00:05:31 anyway whatever i'm getting off topic what i want to say is i love the fact that leg extensions are cheap and what i even
00:05:37 love more than that is the fact that i need leg extensions for my weakness so it's like super quick way i can kind
00:05:43 of get it get this weakness up to scratch i guess this is the benefit of our
00:05:48 selection exercises right yeah i can do you know front squats i can do  kettlebell
00:05:56 what do you call them   not pistol squats like i forget the word now where you when you where you mounted
00:06:02 right in front under your chin can't think of it anyway there's so many different other exercises
00:06:08 you can do i mean and a lot of those exercises called so many more muscles in you know you know the front squat
00:06:14 like i've said to you guys you know some of you guys have said why don't you do front squats i love front
00:06:18 squats man but for me to be honest with you i'll do front squats if i want to bring up my
00:06:22 upper back because that's what that's that's what gets sore on me man like if i do a set
00:06:25 of 20 with with front squats man the following morning my whole neck
00:06:32 traps areas is jacked and often times start feeling a lift i start falling forward and i start losing my rack
00:06:37 front rack position up for the if i do front squats this thing i can freaking have a sandwich while i'm doing leg
00:06:41 extensions man i can eat an ice cream i can talk to you while i'm doing this thing it's just
00:06:46 one joint like you know isolation exercises have their place as much as i don't like to do them and don't
00:06:51 like think about them i wish squats addressed every little freaking problem i had in the gym
00:06:56 but in this case if you have a lagging muscle you have to attack it  and in this
00:07:01 case i'm attacking it with the cheapest thing possible now i'm doing this thing every single
00:07:05 day i still can't get over it man  you know you could you could say that this exercise is ineffective right because
00:07:12 it's not disturbing you enough it's not inducing enough damage for you to recover for a week
00:07:20 i don't know you know when i do the exercise when i'm in the workout i'm feeling you know like i'm working
00:07:25 really hard quads are pumped i'm walking around like a freaking baboon you know like a whole gorilla posturing
00:07:29 around the place because i've got these big ass squads you can see me here i don't know
00:07:34 what's happening here but i'm pulling my pants up i don't know like maybe my quads have
00:07:39 grown out or maybe the pants have shrunk i don't know what's going on but i don't have enough you know given the
00:07:45 pants to squat these pants anyway  to squirt into the hole anymore so i need to pull them up
00:07:50 whatever maybe maybe the same thing is shrunk or maybe i've grown a little bit whatever so i feel like the leg extensions are
00:07:56 doing something it's definitely if if anything it's telling my brain where my quads are at
00:08:03 it's telling my quads all right you got some tissue here man you might want to use it
00:08:06 and this is why i'm doing it before the squats some of you guys are saying why don't you do it after the squats
00:08:11 i'm looking for the squats so so i can tell my brain all right this is what's happening today
00:08:14 there's muscle here you better use it man we're using this muscle here but if i don't do any kind of activation
00:08:19 exercise you're just going to restrain to the squat my big old glutes you know steal the
00:08:24 party my doctors steal the party my quads are they're like frozen freaking my my quads are frozen everything else
00:08:30 is burning up so if you have a little laggy muscle say it's a hamstring say it's a freaking
00:08:34 tricep whatever smash out a couple of truffles the tricep extensions smash some
00:08:40 hamstring curls or you guys love naughty kills so many of you guys are saying naughty kills
00:08:44 do whatever you want man before whatever exercise you want to do bench press or deadlifts or whatever and you will feel
00:08:48 that muscle working you will have kind of a connection with your brain and you'll be
00:08:52 like oh what's up this is this is what we're using so i think a lot of us you know
00:08:59 me included man  yeah i've spoken about this quite a lot i always thought the
00:09:04 squad is gonna take everything take care of everything i always thought the bench press is gonna take care of
00:09:07 everything it's not like that man our bodies are strange freaking creatures our bodies are always looking for the
00:09:14 path of least resistance and obviously every single human being on this planet has a strength
00:09:21 and therefore has a weakness and our bodies keep jumping on the bandwagon right i'm always always
00:09:26 chasing a bandwagon and jumping on the strengths so when i'm squatting my doctors get hurt my glutes get hurt
00:09:34 everything's hurting there nothing else right it's just it's really interesting so if you're somebody that's squatting
00:09:40 right and a few guys have said this to me you're squatting and then you get this mighty old pump in your lower back
00:09:44 and you have to stop yes there could be some technical things going on there some mobility maybe your
00:09:51 lack internal external rotation and that's kind of making your butt wing happen and that's why your erectors are
00:09:56 getting pumped trying to reverse that but try this man if you can't feel anything else working other than your
00:10:01 lower back try and activating whatever muscle you want say the quad
00:10:07 right with these leg extensions or i don't know go do the good girl bad girl thing you
00:10:11 know get your adductors you know kind of warmed up you know don't smash yourself or just kind of
00:10:17 get them warmed up by the way check this out man i'm gonna play this   video actually
00:10:21 yeah i'll play this video again you'll see that i did  180 times one really narrow but yeah so so if you've never experienced
00:10:34 activation exercises try  you can do anything man the the moral of the story here is that
00:10:40 you're not going for like a full-on balls to the wall thing before your whatever movement just
00:10:45 do it enough to pump some blood in there and to turn on the you know the the i guess the anagram the
00:10:51 neurological anagram to that particular part of the body it's kind of like a map for the brain right
00:10:57 you know you want to go from a to b there's 50 different routes you can take but you want to take a specific route
00:11:03 well if you don't show if you don't have a map to go through that particular route you're not going
00:11:07 to be able to drive through that right so look at the map this this is this is what activation exercises do
00:11:13 it's like a map to a different path to get the job done a to b that's how i think about it man so
00:11:19 you can do this for anything a lot of guys are you know reading through forums and you know
00:11:24 listening to videos all the time a lot of guys a lot of bodybuilders say that they like to do leg leg
00:11:31 curls before squats because it can they kind of feel like it gets blood in there and it makes it easier for for the squat
00:11:36 and makes kind of the knees health healthier and happier and whatnot you know you could do that if your
00:11:41 hamstrings are lagging do that you can do anything you want right everyone's individual there's no you
00:11:47 know cookie cutter stuff here you need to assess yourself see what's up see what you need and then
00:11:52 go from there in my case as i've said my quad seemed to be the problem
00:11:57  in fact i just watched today i watched a video from dave tate elite fts they had juji mufu on there
00:12:05 and it was like a 45 minute video of dave basically telling john you know how to go about increasing
00:12:11 his deadlift to 700 pounds and apparently john has problems with  you know breaking the
00:12:16 weight off the ground off the ground strength which is funny because that's exactly what i'm going through right now um
00:12:21 anyway in this video i kind of kept looking at his squads and yeah they're very very 
00:12:26 weak looking i mean it's strong everything's strong looking but he's got his vmo look very small compared to
00:12:31 the rest of his physique i mean his upper body is incredible like he looks like a
00:12:36 like an animal on top his legs are kind of lagging and especially the quads so you know you can teach you can you
00:12:42 can talk about technique all you want you know if your muscles are lagging there they're going to be weak man right
00:12:48 so if i was here man you know you can shift your weight onto your heels and you can
00:12:51 do deficits deadlifts until the cows come home until you get some mass onto their squads until you get some
00:12:57 proper hypertrophy proper connection with your mind to that muscle you're gonna struggle anyway
00:13:04  in this video as well you can see it now  i did bench press worked up 110 times one
00:13:12 and then also did the bar for 90 kilos in one set as i said to you guys i'm influenced by
00:13:16 bilbo method i'm going to make one of these videos about the bilbao method soon
00:13:21 when i kind of feel confident talking about it but basically i'm pushing stupid reps
00:13:24 with really lightweight on the bench press and it's making me feel alright  so let's see how that kind of goes on
