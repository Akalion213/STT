00:00:02 i am here to sign a document betting ten thousand dollars that my last video is in fact correct
00:00:10 this is the video in question some people may have missed it but in this car there is no motor no batteries
00:00:17 no energy source besides the wind itself and the counter-intuitive claim is that this car can maintain speeds
00:00:25 faster than the wind that's pushing it there is a physics professor at ucla who got in touch to say that he thought
00:00:32 that i was wrong that the explanation was wrong you know we went back and forth a little
00:00:37 bit and eventually i said well how about we bet ten thousand dollars i can prove it to you this vehicle
00:00:44 really can go downwind faster than the wind and to my surprise he is taking me up on the bet look no no one is perfect
00:00:53  but you have a much lower error rate than most  people on youtube in youtube space
00:00:58 now professor alex kusenko wanted this wager and all related discourse to be public in
00:01:03 fact he suggested we get a celebrity to witness the signing so i asked neil degrasse tyson bill nye
00:01:08 and sean carroll to be our witnesses and they graciously agreed and alex i just want to say  i agree
00:01:14 with everything you've said about veritasium that i'm generally i can watch it and not have to wonder
00:01:21 is he going to mess up how am i going to no he's brilliant i'm excited about this bet because if i
00:01:28 am wrong then i want to know like the whole point of the channel is to get to the truth and
00:01:33 that is i think why we're all here today and i think you know this is a great great chance to sort of
00:01:38 see i'm going to summarize alex's main points in this video but i'll put his full presentation here so let me
00:01:43 first explain what i see in the video in the video the vehicle is operated in a gusty wind
00:01:53 initially you have the wind speed are exceeding the car speed but then the wind speed is not constant
00:01:58 the wind speed drops and the car moves by inertia with deceleration for a while so basically alex thinks a
00:02:07 gust pushes the car to a high speed and then when the wind dies the car is going faster than the wind
00:02:13 momentarily but it must be slowing down in fact that will be my conclusion at the end of this presentation that
00:02:17 whenever you have velocity faster than the wind i'll actually show you in an equation
00:02:23 the acceleration is negative the second effect is that the wind in the individual is measured
00:02:29 at the height of about a meter or meter and a half but the propeller goes to some three meters above the ground now due to
00:02:35 interactions with the ground there is a wind gradient wind travels slower close to the ground and then faster
00:02:42 higher up now alex estimated that the wind speed of the propeller might be 10 or 15 percent higher
00:02:48 than at the telltale so it's possible that the car could be moving slower than the wind at the propeller
00:02:53 and yet appear to be moving faster than the wind at the height of the telltale now i think that this is a small effect however
00:03:00 in combination with the previous effect it just can make this more frequent okay and that completes um
00:03:07 if i remember the video correctly derrick reports that they've achieved up to 2.8 times
00:03:12 wind speed that feels much higher than what is possible here unless the
00:03:19 wind had picked up and then spontaneously sort of dropped very very good question okay
00:03:25 if you're going for the record you probably will do many attempts you will be sampling that that gusty
00:03:31 wind over and over and over until you set the record right that's how you set the record
00:03:37 and on one of those occasions you will get a nice strong gust which is three times the app that comes
00:03:42 after it okay and that's when you will clock the record and that's where that
00:03:49 2.8 factor will come in so what about the treadmill tests these are conducted in still air by
00:03:55 moving the ground backwards you're simulating a perfectly steady tailwind and if you hold the car stationary on
00:04:02 the treadmill well that's equivalent to the car going exactly wind speed now if the car can move forward on the treadmill
00:04:11 that shows it can accelerate faster than the wind but alex had multiple explanations why
00:04:16 these experiments don't actually show what they claim to show if you have
00:04:23  this  you know fluctuating speed of the treadmill and then if a human just sort of steers
00:04:29 it it then can introduce unconsciously a bias towards the desired result so what it may be
00:04:36 that the guy with the spork is inducing the model craft to go across the wing now and then so
00:04:48 yeah i'm sure i'm 100 sure that  the guy in the in the video doesn't do it  on purpose
00:04:55 okay yeah however you know if he is expecting  forward drift yeah right yeah absolutely yeah
00:05:01 that's that's what exactly okay so you go in the absence of convincing experimental evidence
00:05:08 alex turned to theoretical analyses like one by mit arrow professor mark drella but here too he found problems his main
00:05:16 concern is that the equation for net force includes the difference between the speeds of the car and the wind
00:05:22 in the denominator which seems to imply that when traveling exactly wind speed you should get
00:05:27 infinite force now here's a real danger because if if derek drives very close to the wind
00:05:34 that difference in speed goes to zero if it's one millionth of a one percent that's like a nuclear
00:05:41 bomb exploding behind him then derek is definitely in trouble right so we need we need to
00:05:46 find something to save derek's life here this is this is serious right but dividing by zero come on you guys i
00:05:52 never looked at that alex performed his own analysis and found no such divide by zero problems
00:05:59 in fact he found there's no way for the cart to accelerate at or above wind speed the acceleration
00:06:07 of this craft is negative so when we you know so it's possible to move the craft faster than the wind but it's not
00:06:11 possible to move it at zero acceleration which would be needed to maintain constant
00:06:18 speed that is basically where we left it right thank you neil thank you very much guys thanks dale
00:06:24 so now it was up to me to convince professor kosenko that blackbird really can go faster than the wind
00:06:31 but his presentation was effective when i posted about it on twitter alice zhang who runs chinese veritasium
00:06:37 said i think you lost derek i'm 80 on alex's side now what's amazing to me is that neither one of them
00:06:43 had seen my attempts to replicate the treadmill experiments for the first video i asked my friend
00:06:49 and youtube maker xyla foxlin to make a model downwind cart version one ended in failure but xyla
00:06:58 was undeterred coming back in a couple days with version two is it feeling like it's gonna
00:07:05 unlike these models most of her projects actually work she is determined so maybe this tells us something
00:07:12 about whether you can actually go faster than the wind downwind what was clear to me is that i
00:07:17 didn't do a good enough job in the first video explaining how blackbird works and providing convincing evidence
00:07:23 that it can really go faster than the wind in a sustained way in my defense i thought the concept was
00:07:29 well enough established way back in 1969 andrew bauer built the first successful downwind cart and he did it
00:07:37 to settle a friendly wager with aero engineer apollo smith the bet was inspired by a claim in a
00:07:43 student's paper from 20 years earlier now rick cavallaro the builder of blackbird was completely unaware of all
00:07:49 this until after he built his cart but other analyses have been published under names like the push me
00:07:55 pull you boat so i didn't honestly think anyone would doubt the vehicle's operation much less bet me ten
00:08:00 thousand dollars but clearly there is a need for a deeper explanation so i want to do that now by responding
00:08:07 to the points alex raised so first let's deal with wind gradient i mean why didn't we measure the speed of
00:08:12 the wind higher up well the answer is because it's already been done
00:08:18 they mounted telltales on fishing poles out to the sides of the propeller and even above it now although the lowest
00:08:24 telltale flips back first all of the telltales do eventually flip backwards showing that
00:08:29 every part of the vehicle is going faster than the wind could this be because of a big wind gust
00:08:34 that pushed the car up to high speed and then the wind died i don't think so
00:08:39 even though i didn't have a speedometer in the car for my runs someone on twitter pointed out that we
00:08:44 could use the rotation of the back wheel to determine the speed from the video footage this shows
00:08:49 that even after the telltale flips backwards the car keeps accelerating another thing i want to point out is
00:08:57 that if wind gradient or gusts were the reason that the car travels faster than the wind
00:09:02 well you'd expect the telltale to jump around or at least not point straight back at me
00:09:07 but it consistently does for over 30 seconds until i had to hit the brakes to avoid crashing into parked vehicles
00:09:14 but if that's not enough for you when blackbird achieved its record speed of 27.7 miles per hour
00:09:20 in a 10 mile per hour tailwind it was still accelerating and we know this because there were multiple gps units
00:09:27 in the car and wind speeds which were measured at the height of the propeller at multiple locations the highlighted
00:09:33 section shows the 10 second measurement period over which the record was set also in 2013 the us
00:09:41 physics olympiad semi-final exam asked questions about blackbird like can it go faster than the wind
00:09:46 downwind and upwind the solution says both modes are possible and with sufficiently low energy loss
00:09:53 any speed is possible now i'll admit that the evidence i showed in the first video
00:10:01 was not definitive wind gusts or gradients could have explained the observations but now that you've seen
00:10:07 this evidence are you convinced that blackbird can go downwind faster than the wind
00:10:12 without slowing down well professor casenko was not convinced so i want to explain how the car works
00:10:19 so clearly that no one not even the professor can doubt what's going on the first thing to know is that the
00:10:24 propeller doesn't work like most people think it's not working like a windmill it doesn't turn the way the tailwind is
00:10:30 pushing it instead it turns in the opposite direction working like a fan
00:10:36 to push air backwards this fan is powered by the wheels which are connected to the propeller by
00:10:41 a bike chain so at wind speed the car can keep accelerating because the wheels turn the fan which blows air back
00:10:48 generating forward thrust now the big question is to drive the fan there must be a
00:10:53 backwards force on the wheels which tends to slow them down so why isn't this force bigger than the
00:10:59 thrust from the propeller causing the car to slow down overall well the answer is the wheels
00:11:06 are going so much faster over the ground than the propeller is moving through the air so the thrust force can actually be larger
00:11:12 i'm going to do an analysis in the frame of reference of the car and the important equation to know is
00:11:18 power equals force times velocity so at the wheels power is input into the system by the ground moving underneath
00:11:24 the car the power generated is the force of the ground on the wheels
00:11:30 times the velocity of the car at the propeller work is done on the air as the propeller pushes it backwards
00:11:37 the power out equals the force of the prop on the air times the speed of the car minus the
00:11:42 speed of the wind the prop is going slower through the air due to the tailwind
00:11:48 and if we assume no losses then the power in at the wheels equals the power out at the propeller
00:11:53 from this equation we can see that the force at the propeller will be greater than the force at the wheels
00:11:59 and since the propeller is pushing air back the air applies an equal and opposite force
00:12:06 forward on the prop this is the thrust force which will be greater than the backwards force
00:12:12 on the wheels so this car works like a lever or a pulley by applying a small force to the wheels
00:12:19 over a larger distance the propeller can apply a larger force over a smaller distance
00:12:25 this is just like when you're riding a bike going uphill you move the pedals fast but with
00:12:31 smaller force to make the wheels move slower over the ground but with a bigger force but now we've
00:12:37 run into the divide by zero problem that professor kosenko warned us about when the speed of the car is exactly equal to the speed
00:12:43 of the wind it seems like the propeller can provide infinite force
00:12:49 that can't be right can it i mean is our analysis flawed the answer is no for two reasons first
00:12:56 of all this is exactly what you'd expect theoretically with any lever or pulley if one arm of the
00:13:01 lever is zero then you can lift an infinite weight with any amount of force on the other side
00:13:07 the catch is its displacement will be zero second of all in practice there is a propeller efficiency term that is
00:13:14 ill-defined when the propeller is not moving through the air there is a better formula for the prop
00:13:18 efficiency which is well defined in the zero air speed limit it makes an algebraic mess but
00:13:25 it's perfectly well defined and then the divide by zero problem is eliminated but that equation makes the problem look
00:13:32 more complicated than it actually is you don't actually need aerodynamics here i have a little cart with a big wheel
00:13:41 that rolls on two smaller spools and what i'm going to show is that when you have two media
00:13:47 moving relative to one another well then if this car is in contact with both media it can actually move
00:13:55 faster than their relative velocity so as i push the board to the right you can see that the car goes down the board
00:14:05 faster than the board is moving if you look carefully you'll see that the big wheel
00:14:11 isn't turning the way that the board is pushing it it's actually rotating in the opposite direction
00:14:17 that's just like the propeller on blackbird which pushes back against the air and that's how it's
00:14:23 able to go faster than the wind downwind now you can build one of these cars for
00:14:29 yourself at home or you can build a model downwind cart i told you xyla was determined yeah
00:14:37 i'm going to make the claim on camera i like i think it's going to work this time we're changing the propeller it has
00:14:43 to work before we get kicked out of the does it work it totally works amazing oh my god it's so good her fourth
00:15:04 version of the cart works spectacularly and it was designed to be replicated by anyone using just a 3d printer and a
00:15:10 simple list of materials she explains how to build it with more details on the engineering process on a
00:15:15 video over on her channel so go check it out now professor casenko has now conceded the bet
00:15:21 and he transferred ten thousand dollars to me so i want to thank him for being a man of honor
00:15:26 and changing his mind in light of the evidence i presented which is really not easy to do
00:15:31 especially in a public debate like this one now i do not want to keep the money i want to invest it
00:15:38 in science communication so i'm holding a one minute video competition i'll be awarding cash prizes
00:15:45 to the top three videos that explain a counter-intuitive stem concept i'll put some details down in the description
00:15:52 what i love about science is that disagreements are not problems they are opportunities for
00:15:58 everyone to learn something i learned a lot more about blackbird aerodynamics and gear ratios than i knew before i
00:16:06 also learned that i should go into more depth in my videos i should make the evidence overwhelmingly convincing and put in
00:16:11 some equations toward the end for those who want that level of detail i want to thank everyone
00:16:16 involved in the making this video neil degrasse tyson bill nye shawn carroll mark drella professor cosenko
00:16:23 and xyla foxlin but especially rick cavallaro the inventor and creator of blackbird he was a fountain of information a
00:16:30 constant source of support and the man leading the charge to help people understand this area of physics for the past
00:16:37 15 years let's hope this video puts the issue to rest the blackbird craft all started with a
00:16:47 brain teaser and this video sponsor brilliant offers you a daily problem to solve every day like this one about gear ratios
00:16:55 if the first gear spins 10 times per second at what rate does the final gear spin now i did this problem the hard way but
00:17:00 my wife figured out how to do it the easy way and that's what brain teasers are great
00:17:04 for they get you thinking about the world and they give you insights into problems you might think
00:17:09 you already understand just think about how much more you would understand in a year
00:17:15 if you got into the habit of solving one novel unexpected problem per day and while you're at it why not take one
00:17:21 of brilliant's courses like on computer science neural networks or classical physics even physics professors can benefit from
00:17:27 some lessons on frames of reference somehow i managed to go my whole degree without learning lacranjian mechanics so
00:17:33 that's a course i'm working through at the moment it's a really elegant way of solving physics problems and i wish i
00:17:38 had learned about it sooner for viewers of this channel brilliant are offering 20
00:17:44 off an annual subscription to the first 200 people to sign up just go to brilliant.org veritasium i will put that link down in
00:17:50 the description so i want to thank brilliant for supporting veritasium and i want to
