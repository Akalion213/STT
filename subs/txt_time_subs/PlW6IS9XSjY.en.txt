00:00:07 we are still in search of worlds where life could be found every day scientists find more and more
00:00:16 potentially habitable worlds in april 2021 astronomers discovered a super earth exoplanet and a bunch of other possible habitable
00:00:26 exoplanets and now we're going to show you what they found so get ready as we explore these new found
00:00:35 alien worlds we've got gas giants to show you where life could be hiding in their
00:00:39 clouds and a weird neptune-like planet that could be the best candidate
00:00:56 for the last 25 years astronomers have been finding a wide variety of exoplanets made out of rock ice
00:01:02 and gas the kepler spacecraft launched in 2009 and monitored 155 000 stars in just one
00:01:10 small patch of the milky way its mission to look for tiny dips in starlight caused by an exoplanet passing in front
00:01:16 of its star by the time the spacecraft ran out of fuel in october of 2018
00:01:23 it had found 4 000 candidate worlds among those stars that could be earth-like a new analysis of data from the kepler spacecraft
00:01:31 just doubled the number of habitable exoplanets believed to exist in our galaxy there are at least 100 billion stars in
00:01:38 the milky way and 4 billion of those are sun-like if you figured only seven percent of
00:01:45 those stars have some habitable planet floating around it that's 300 million potentially habitable earths
00:01:53 in the milky way anyone remember luke skywalker's harsh desert home planet tatuni that had two sons well
00:02:01 researchers in may 2021 re-analyzed some kepler space telescope data and discovered not one but five star
00:02:07 wars style double sun systems that could have one planet each
00:02:13 that support life in some form or another this time researchers were looking for earth-like planets with
00:02:20 water somewhere on their surface so they looked at the mass of the binary stars how bright they were how big and how
00:02:27 close they were to planets in the system researchers now say they found a planet in one of these systems
00:02:33 that's cool enough to have liquid water on its surface it's in the system kepler 38 about 3970
00:02:40 light years from earth has a star like ours and another smaller star that orbits it
00:02:46 this system is the best candidate for hosting an earth-like world with oceans so far a neptune-sized planet has been
00:02:54 found orbiting the largest star and there might be more planets in its very recently astronomers discovered
00:03:04 another exoplanet some 90 light years away from earth that was a big surprise
00:03:10 another neptune-like world was discovered with an atmosphere that could have clouds containing water
00:03:18 toi 1231b is a bit larger than earth but a bit smaller than neptune it's eight times closer to its star than our
00:03:25 planet is to the sun the surface temperature was measured to be about 60 degrees celsius
00:03:31 even though it's too big to be habitable it's the coolest exoplanet ever found and will be a perfect target for the
00:03:38 study of exoplanet atmospheres by the way we've heard some strange new things that have been discovered
00:03:45 on the ice giants uranus and neptune if you want to hear more about that then sound off in the comments
00:03:51 it's true that most of the super earth exo planets we find and call habitable end up being
00:03:57 too hot to support life a good example of this is a planet orbiting the star gliese 486
00:04:03 it's a hot rocky super earth with a mass of 2.8 times of our home planet and it's 30 percent bigger
00:04:10 the problem is that this super earth has a temperature of 700 kelvin however even though it's so hot this
00:04:17 planet has kept part of its original atmosphere and that was discovered using transit photometry and radial velocity spectroscopy
00:04:25 another example of a scorched super earth was just discovered 36 light years from earth named
00:04:33 gj740b it's a potentially rocky world that has a mass of 2.9 earths and takes 2.4 days to orbit its star
00:04:40 a red dwarf that can't be seen from earth however this planet is no place to call home
00:04:47 with temperatures as high as 829 kelvin and the surface probably looks a lot like venus
00:04:52 it seems like finding exoplanets that could have life is turning out to be a tough search
00:04:58 and there are more gas and ice giant exoplanets being found than terrestrial planets this is because gas and ice giants are
00:05:04 easier to find by the tidal doppler shifts on their parent stars from gravitational pull
00:05:12 but they're also more easily seen during transits because of their size and caused the light spectrum to curve and dip a lot
00:05:19 more than a smaller rocky planet like the earth is it possible we could find life on one
00:05:27 of these gas giants if we're going to look for life we shouldn't limit our search to earth-like planets
00:05:33 and gas giants shouldn't be ignored either carl sagan and stephen hawking both theorize that life could exist in
00:05:40 atmospheres of gas giants and out of the thousands of exoplanet candidates discovered by kepler
00:05:46 the most common of those are hot jupiter-like exoplanets that orbit very close to their parent star
00:05:53 but these are gas planets we're talking about with no solid surface that would allow any earth-like life to exist
00:05:59 but is it possible that some kind of extremophile a creature like a tardigrade could be living in the clouds of a gas planet
00:06:07 gas giants are mainly composed of hydrogen and helium and even though it might sound
00:06:12 far-fetched it might be just possible that life could evolve in the upper atmosphere of a gas giant
00:06:18 the debate of whether life could exist in the toxic clouds of venus is still far from over scientists had
00:06:24 detected the chemical phosphine in the thick venetian atmosphere and researchers were saying that something now alive
00:06:32 is the only explanation as the source of the chemical could gas planets have the same possibility
00:06:38 chances are good that if we find life it will be totally different than we expect life forms on a gas planet could survive
00:06:45 on electrical energy from lighting storms could get water from vapor in the air and be able to filter water out of the
00:06:51 air they breathe or it could even be some type of airborne bacteria
00:06:56 that doesn't need to breathe at all eliminating the need for oxygen but there is also the possibility of
00:07:02 finding a gas planet that's made up of breathable air of course this life form would need to deal with the extreme
00:07:08 pressure of living on a gas giant and there are some big gas giants that have been found
00:07:13 astronomers found a super gas giant roughly five times heavier than jupiter about 1300 light years from earth
00:07:21 they named the gas giant got em1b which stands for giant outer transiting exoplanet mass
00:07:27 and we're finding a lot more planets like this each day but going over and reanalyzing old data
00:07:32 from the kepler spacecraft isn't all we've got going for us when it comes to finding exoplanets
00:07:38 there's another telescope out there the successor to kepler and it's finding tons of new exoplanets
00:07:42 it's called tess and it launched aboard a spacex falcon 9 rocket back in april 2018.
00:07:50 right now tess is our best and most adept planet finder and it's found more than 2 200 candidate
00:07:57 planets orbiting bright stars and hundreds of those could be rocky now a new era in the study of exoplanets
00:08:07 is just beginning using a technique called transmission spectroscopy scientists
00:08:12 should be able to use the hubble telescope and soon the james webb space telescope to capture starlight shining
00:08:18 through the atmosphere of toi 1231b molecules in this planet's atmosphere will absorb slices of light
00:08:24 from this spectrum leaving dark lines that can be read like a barcode and tell us which gases are present
00:08:31 when our new telescopes are finally up and running we'll be able to discover exactly what an exoplanet's atmosphere
00:08:35 is made of and we'll be able to detect water vapor as well as oxygen
00:08:42 which could mean life and by the way you don't just need to be a nasa scientist to find an exoplanet either
00:08:48 just recently in june 2021 a citizen scientist named cesar rubio discovered not one but two gas planets that orbit around a bright
00:08:56 sun-like star as part of a project that nasa has called planet hunters tess it's been in the
00:09:02 news a lot lately but the james webb space telescope won't be the only telescope going up
00:09:07 and out into space the upcoming roman space telescope mission will probably find another
00:09:13 100 000 new worlds as they transit across their host star and also use a method called
00:09:19 microlensing this is the first telescope that will try to directly image giant planets just think about it only a
00:09:26 few short decades ago we didn't know if planets were common or rare around other stars with all these new discoveries we now
00:09:33 have evidence that our own galaxy is filled with other worlds and some of those worlds
00:09:37 might host life and if you're interested in helping find new planets you can check out
00:09:43 nasa's planet hunters website for all the details what did you think about the video do
00:09:47 you think we're gonna find life on another planet soon and if we do how do you think it's going
