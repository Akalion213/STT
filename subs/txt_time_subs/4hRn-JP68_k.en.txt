00:00:14 quantum field theory i like to think of it as the language of physics we use it to describe the
00:00:19 elementary particles and the forces between them we use it to describe properties of materials
00:00:27 phases of materials phase transitions between them we do to describe cosmology the
00:00:31 expanding universe the theory of inflation and most importantly we use it in the context of quantum gravity and string theory
00:00:40 where quantum field theory appears in many different places so it appears to be central not only
00:00:47 in string theory but in all of physics for this reason it is very important very central and very exciting
00:00:54 mathematics is essential in describing nature we have seen that over the last century if not millennia physics uses
00:01:02 mathematics this has also been the case for centuries and mathematics is central in quantum field theory at the same time
00:01:09 quantum filter is not mathematically rigorous these are the hallmarks of a topic where we are at the forefront of research
00:01:18 mathematicians appreciate that there's something very deep going on here because quantum field theory has had a
00:01:24 lot of impact on mathematics but at the same time mathematicians are very interested in the fact that there
00:01:30 is this machine quantum field theory that keeps producing new results in mathematics this machine is not yet rigorous
00:01:40 from my own perspective mathematicians should view it as a challenge to make it more rigorous
00:01:45 but also at the same time it's an opportunity because making it more rigorous will certainly lead to new ideas
00:01:53 we shouldn't think of it as two separate disciplines math and physics but there is one intellectual structure that all of us would like to
00:02:01 understand and one day we'll understand what will quantum field theory lead to what will it encompass
00:02:11 the quick answer is it i do not know it's common in research that we don't know what we will find
00:02:17 that's what makes research so exciting if we knew what it would find it would not be research and it would not be that interesting
00:02:25 most interesting discoveries over the last several centuries were totally unexpected and that's what
