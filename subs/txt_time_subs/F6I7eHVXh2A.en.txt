00:00:12 including free shipping this is istanbul it's the largest city in the world with territory on two continents
00:00:19 europe and asia more than 15 million people live here which makes it the seventh largest city
00:00:24 in asia and the number one largest city in europe it's also one of the most famous and
00:00:29 well-known cities that humanity has ever built it has served as the capital city for three
00:00:36 great historical empires the romans the byzantines and the ottomans and it's been the largest city in the
00:00:42 world on two separate historical occasions during both the 7th and 17th centuries today nearly 1 out of every 5 turks live
00:00:52 in istanbul the city accounts for over half of all turkey's trade and it has an economy larger than the
00:00:58 entirety of south africa most of istanbul's power and influence upon the world is rooted in the city's geography
00:01:06 and excellent strategic location it's positioned directly adjacent to this the bosphorus straight a narrow water
00:01:13 passage that divides europe from asia and connects the black sea with the aegean and mediterranean
00:01:19 historically it's the only possible path that bulgaria romania ukraine georgia and the southwestern
00:01:25 part of russia can use to reach the mediterranean sea and the global world ocean from there out of either the suez or gibraltar
00:01:34 so obviously the bosphorus is absolutely critical to all of these countries for international trade
00:01:40 but especially to russia the world's second largest exporter of oil who has to ship nearly
00:01:45 all of it from their ports here on the black sea that remain warm and ice-free year-round the bosphorus is basically the only way
00:01:53 for these large russian oil tankers to get out into the world's oceans but the strait is important to dozens of
00:01:59 other countries as well because of this the danube this is the second longest river in europe
00:02:07 and its mouth is located directly on the black sea the river flows for thousands of kilometers directly through
00:02:14 important european cities like vienna bratislava budapest and belgrade and since 1992 it also connects directly to the rhine
00:02:23 river and the port of rotterdam europe's largest commercial trading hub cargo ships traveling between shanghai
00:02:30 the busiest port in asia and rotterdam the busiest port in europe will almost always travel through the
00:02:36 suez canal and will then sometimes choose to pass through the bosphorus into the danube across into
00:02:41 the rhine and then up to rotterdam all of this contributes to making the bosphorous
00:02:47 strait one of the busiest trade routes in the entire world with more than three times the
00:02:53 commercial traffic as the suez canal sees and it makes istanbul one of earth's most strategic locations
00:03:01 but despite that turkey itself benefits very little from this possession today they literally make zero dollars from it
00:03:07 they can't allow certain allied warships through it and in order to fix all of that
00:03:13 turkey is planning on transforming istanbul their biggest and most important city
00:03:19 into an island and here's why in 1923 after the first world war in the turkish war of independence
00:03:25 the new turkish republic signed the treaty of lausanne which demilitarized the turkish straits and opened them up to
00:03:33 unrestricted civilian maritime traffic but by the 1930s with the rise of fascist italy and her colonies directly
00:03:38 off of the turkish coast the mediterranean's geopolitical situation had changed dramatically
00:03:44 and turkey sought to alter the terms of lausanne this led directly to the montreal convention
00:03:50 of 1936 which enabled turkey to re-militarize the straits in order to protect
00:03:54 themselves from italy and it heavily restricted the ability of non-black sea
00:04:00 adjacent powers from sending any warships through while it also guaranteed the free
00:04:04 passage of all civilian commercial ships in times of both peace and war and outlawed turkey from ever being able to
00:04:11 charge or collect any tolls or fees at the time this was a great deal for turkey because it all but guaranteed their
00:04:17 neutrality during the second world war and it was a boon for the soviet union because it would end up preventing
00:04:23 any axis warships from being able to enter into the black sea for the entirety of the second world war
00:04:29 but over the decades since world war ii ended numerous controversies have been raised over the treaty's status
00:04:36 immediately after the war ended the soviets demanded joint control with turkey over the bosphorus
00:04:43 and a permanent soviet military presence there turkey rejected these demands but the soviets got clever
00:04:50 the montreal convention established that no more than nine foreign warships with a total
00:04:56 aggregate tonnage of 15 000 tons may pass through the bosphorus at any one single time
00:05:01 so to cheese the system a bit the soviets would simply keep one of their own larger warships
00:05:08 inside of the bosphorus at all times that would almost always maximize the 15 000 tons of
00:05:14 foreign warships allowed inside of the bosphorus in effect this prevented any other powers besides turkey
00:05:20 from ever being able to pass any warships through so turkey knew that they couldn't resist
00:05:26 the soviet union's pressure alone and so in 1952 they decided to join nato which only further provoked the soviet's
00:05:32 reaction towards the strait now being effectively in the hands of their cold war adversaries
00:05:38 but the united states hasn't been very happy with the arrangement either non-black sea nations warships are
00:05:45 severely restricted with ever being able to use the bosphorus including the united states ships with
00:05:51 gun calibers larger than 8 inches are on the ban list so to get around it in the 1960s the
00:05:56 united states sent missile cruisers through the soviets of course protested this
00:06:03 but turkey argued successfully that the missiles aboard the u.s ships weren't in fact actually guns
00:06:10 and that since such weapons didn't exist back in 1936 when the treaty was signed they were not part of the restrictions
00:06:16 however the convention is still a hindrance to u.s military buildup in the black sea
00:06:22 i mean the u.s navy is literally everywhere and they'd like to go for the 100 completion achievement in the black sea
00:06:29 too but montreal limits their ability to send any significant large ships through the bosphorus like
00:06:36 say aircraft carriers and submarines in 1994 the united nations convention on the law of the sea
00:06:42 or unclose came into force that largely defines the rights and responsibilities of nations out on the world's oceans
00:06:49 nearly every country in the world has signed on to this agreement except for notably turkey and the united states even though
00:06:56 the treaty would place the bosphorous straight within turkish territorial waters and theoretically overrule the montreal convention
00:07:03 and give turkey greater autonomy over administrating it they have always refused to sign it
00:07:08 because doing so would also surrender nearly the entire aegean sea
00:07:15 to greece's territorial waters while the u.s largely refuses to sign because it would place the critical northwest
00:07:21 passage within canadian territorial waters rather than international waters so the turks are therefore legally still stuck
00:07:29 with the clunky and dated terms of the 1936 montreal convention that restricts their ability to make any money
00:07:35 and restricts u.s warships from being able to access the black sea america and turkey's interests are
00:07:41 therefore both directly aligned with subverting both unclose and montreau so in order to get around both of them
00:07:49 and have their cake and eat it too turkey could theoretically just
00:07:55 build an artificial canal directly adjacent to the natural bosphorus strait this is because technically the
00:08:02 restrictive terms of the montreal convention only apply to the bosphorous strait itself or so argues turkey by building an
00:08:10 artificial canal directly next to the bosphorus and transforming istanbul itself into an island
00:08:16 turkey argues that it could begin charging tolls there and finally begin allowing us and nato
00:08:22 aircraft carriers and submarines into the black sea for the first time and this
00:08:28 is all exactly what turkey is planning on doing with their istanbul canal megaproject
00:08:33 which just began construction a few months ago back in march of 2021 the plan currently is to construct the
00:08:41 canal 30 kilometers to the west of the bosphorus on the european side of turkey and make it 45 kilometers long from end
00:08:47 to end for comparison the suez canal is nearly 200 kilometers long
00:08:54 so from an engineering perspective the boss first canal is totally doable but turkey's stated reasons for
00:09:00 constructing the canal however have nothing to do at all with bypassing the montreal convention
00:09:06 as one of the world's busiest shipping lanes the boss first strait is almost always massively congested with traffic
00:09:14 over 41 000 ships will pass through the narrow strait every year and when arriving ships
00:09:19 usually have to join a queue and wait an average of 14 hours just to pass through and sometimes
00:09:25 they have to wait for days when it's especially busy hundreds of ships will literally just be
00:09:31 sitting outside of the strait at a time waiting for their turn to pass through and that's all without some idiot
00:09:36 getting their ship stuck inside building a canal adjacent to the bosphorus would immediately help
00:09:42 alleviate a lot of this traffic and turkey claims that it will be capable of supporting up to 160 ships crossing per
00:09:49 day about the same number of transits that are currently just passing through the bosphorus
00:09:54 it would also help divert a lot of the dangerous cargo passing through the bosphorus right next door to the
00:10:00 istanbul city center 15 million people live nearby the shores of the bosphorus
00:10:06 and as has been seen by incidents like the beirut explosion or the halifax explosion from the past
00:10:13 dangerous cargo like munitions oil or fertilizer pose a severe risk of explosion during a collision event
00:10:19 such an incident taking place in the bosphorus isn't entirely unlikely given the huge amount of oil and
00:10:25 natural gas that russia ships through it not to mention russian and turkish warships submarines
00:10:30 the huge number of transits per day the busy ferry traffic that criss crosses between istanbul's two sides
00:10:36 and the difficult to navigate waters and most of these factors weren't even present in places like beirut or halifax and
00:10:43 those still happened so probably better to divert all of that dangerous cargo west along a new canal away from the
00:10:48 city center anyway the only problem to that line of argument is that turkey also wants to
00:10:54 extensively develop the banks of the new canal with brand new real estate the entire canal project is a part of turkey's vision
00:11:03 2023 plan and once hopefully finished by then will mark the centennial anniversary of the modern turkish republic's existence
00:11:10 the canal will link up with the newly constructed istanbul airport which when fully completed in the middle of
00:11:16 the 2020s will be the largest airport in the world capable of accommodating 200 million
00:11:21 passengers a year turkey expects that the canal's construction will cost approximately 15
00:11:28 billion dollars and it's monstrously controversial on the plus side the turkish government expects that the canal will alleviate
00:11:34 congestion in the bosphorus strait speed up international trade divert dangerous cargo from istanbul city
00:11:40 center open up more developed real estate and provide a way to finally monetize their geostrategic location with tolls
00:11:47 and fees that could be as high according to them as eight billion dollars a year which
00:11:52 would be 30 percent higher revenue than the suez canal generates for egypt
00:11:57 but critics believe that well pretty much none of that is actually going to happen first of all constructing the canal is
00:12:03 only going to serve a means for turkey to bypass the montreal convention not overturn it merchant ships are still going to be
00:12:10 guaranteed free and unrestricted access to the bosphorous even after the canal is built
00:12:16 so many people pretty rightfully wonder how turkey will convince people to actually use it turkey argues that
00:12:22 the canal will basically serve as a quicker express lane that ships can move through to avoid the long wait times
00:12:27 that are seen at the bosphorus and they plan to make the bus first wait times even worse to encourage the
00:12:33 canal's use a little more the montreal convention grants turkey the authority to screen
00:12:38 all ships passing through the bosphorus for sanitary and environmental safety so theoretically
00:12:46 turkey could and probably would expand on this authority to make very very long sanitary and or
00:12:52 environmental checks on all ships passing through the bosphorus but offer no such checks through their canal that
00:12:58 people are actually paying to use still though it's feared by many that a lot of ships just aren't going to care
00:13:03 and will choose to continue using the bosphorus for free even if the wait times are a bit longer
00:13:08 it's sort of like how people feel about using youtube premium but that's neither here nor there
00:13:13 anyway the canal itself will also necessitate the displacement of thousands of residents who currently
00:13:17 live within its direct path it'll probably do untold environmental damage by contaminating istanbul's groundwater
00:13:23 destroy a major reservoir that provides for one-fifth of istanbul's already strained drinking water supply
00:13:29 and more interestingly some of the property along the canal's planned route is already owned by members of the
00:13:35 qatari royal family and by this guy barat al-baryak the turkish minister of finance
00:13:41 and the son-in-law of president erdogan himself meaning that he would personally benefit from the canal's resulting real
00:13:46 estate development and even further China  has ambitions with serbia and greece to potentially
00:13:52 construct their own canal from the aegean directly into the danube river which if built would provide a way for
00:13:58 ships to completely circumvent the entire bosphorus anyway by moving between the aegean danube and
00:14:04 black sea i've previously made an entire video about this project and if turkey charges too much for their
00:14:09 canal China  might just end up building their own with the help of serbia and greece in order to get around it
00:14:15 as a result of all of these factors the istanbul canal is heavily opposed within istanbul
00:14:21 itself with one poll suggesting that a full 80 percent of istanbul citizens are opposed to its construction
00:14:27 and a mere eight percent supporting it but the canal is also heavily opposed by many outside powers
00:14:35 most notably and obviously russia turkey and by extension nato and the united states argue that the montreal convention will
00:14:42 not apply to the new istanbul canal and that could theoretically enable massive u.s ships
00:14:48 aircraft carriers and submarines into the black sea for the very first time right on russia's doorstep near critical
00:14:56 locations such as crimea ukraine and the donbass region where russia is actively fighting a war
00:15:03 naturally russia rather enjoys the current status quo then enables their warships to come and go as they please
00:15:09 while restricting their enemies movements so they argue that the montro convention would still apply to the istanbul canal
00:15:17 and that would also mean that legally turkey wouldn't be able to charge any fees or collect any revenue
00:15:24 for their 15 billion canal investment so if the canal ends up being built it will probably
00:15:29 massively strain relations between russia and turkey and also as a bonus probably jeopardize
00:15:34 russia's monopoly of power in the black sea near their critical ambitions in ukraine because of all these potential foreign consequences
00:15:43 104 former turkish admirals and naval officers signed an open letter expressing their objection to the
00:15:48 canal's construction citing that the montreal convention guaranteed turkish neutrality during
00:15:53 times of war and prevented conflict from ever breaking out in the black sea
00:15:59 between the united states and russia and that bypassing it could open turkey and the black sea
00:16:05 up to future conflict but the very next day 10 of these admirals were arrested and jailed by the turkish government
00:16:12 effectively quashing all of their resistance president erdogan and the turkish government are fully committed to
00:16:20 completing the istanbul canal by 2023 which will change istanbul's turkeys and the world's geography
00:16:27 and reality forever the boss first strait is vitally important for several industries and resources
00:16:34 but perhaps none are as important as wheat russia and ukraine are the world's largest and fifth largest exporters of
00:16:41 wheat respectively and together they export more wheat than the entire north american continent does combined
00:16:49 the middle east alone absorbs more than 80 percent of these massive eastern european wheat exports
00:16:56 which means that the vital flow of food to the middle east and money to russia and ukraine
00:17:02 inevitably all flows directly through the bus for a straight and any disruption in that supply chain can
00:17:09 prove to have catastrophic consequences like it did in 2010 that year russia and ukraine experienced a once in a
00:17:16 century drought event that crippled their wheat production and in a bid to protect her own domestic
00:17:21 wheat farmers russia temporarily banned all of her weed exports
00:17:26 eighty percent of the middle east's wheat imports were suddenly and immediately cut off leading to
00:17:32 widespread food shortages which in part contributed to the arab spring event that year
00:17:38 that led to revolution and civil wars across the arab world any disruption in the bosphorus could
00:17:44 hypothetically lead to similar events taking place which is why this tiny straight
00:17:52 is so important to so many people outside of turkey at the end of the day everybody needs food and ideally you
00:18:00 need to eat good food too i used to eat nothing but takeout because i didn't have any time to go
00:18:06 shopping and prep and make meals so delivery was always the quick and easy alternative
00:18:11 the problem is though takeout isn't healthy and it isn't cheap either so eventually i wanted to find a
00:18:17 healthier cheaper and similarly convenient alternative and that's why i started to use
00:18:23 hellofresh seriously i've been having meals delivered to my front door by hella fresh now for over a year
00:18:28 and i've got dozens of recipes that i've collected from them it's so convenient because every week a
