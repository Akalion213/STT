00:00:04 this is a video about things like cars phones and light bulbs and an actual conspiracy
00:00:10 that made them worse this video was sponsored by nordvpn more about them
00:00:18 at the end of the video i am outside livermore fire station number six and in here they have the longest continuously on
00:00:25 light bulb in the world it has been on for 120 years since 1901 there it is huh
00:00:35 it's not even connected to a light switch but it does have a backup battery and generator
00:00:41 so the big question is how has this light bulb lasted so long it was manufactured by hand not long
00:00:47 after commercial light bulbs were first invented in yet it has been running for over a million hours
00:00:53 way longer than any light bulb today is meant to last a while back a friend of mine told me
00:00:58 this story that someone had invented a light bulb that would last forever
00:01:04 years ago but they never sold it because an everlasting light bulb makes for a terrible business model
00:01:09 i mean you would never have any repeat customers and eventually you would run out of people to sell light bulbs to
00:01:16 i thought this story sounded ridiculous if you could make an everlasting light bulb then everyone would buy your light bulb
00:01:22 over the competitors and so you could charge really high prices make a lot of money even if demand
00:01:28 would eventually dry up i just couldn't imagine that we had better light bulbs in the past
00:01:33 and then intentionally made them worse but it turns out i was wrong at least sort of
00:01:42 inventing a viable electric light was hard i mean this is the typical incandescent design which just involves passing
00:01:47 electric current through a material making it so hot that it glows you know less than five percent of the electrical
00:01:54 energy comes out as light the other 95 percent is released as heat so these are really heat bulbs which
00:02:01 give off a little bit of light as a byproduct you know the temperature of the filament can get up to
00:02:09 2800 kelvin that is half as hot as the surface of the sun at temperatures like those most
00:02:15 materials melt and if they don't melt they burn which is why in the 1840s warren de la rue came up with the idea
00:02:23 of putting the filament in a vacuum bulb so there's no oxygen to react with by 1879 thomas edison had made a bulb with a
00:02:31 cotton thread filament that lasted 14 hours other inventors created bulbs with platinum filaments or
00:02:39 other carbonized materials and gradually the lifespan of bulbs increased the filaments changed from
00:02:45 carbon to tungsten which has a very high melting point and by the early 1920s
00:02:51 average bulb lifetimes were approaching 2 000 hours with some lasting 2500 hours but this
00:02:59 is when lifetimes stopped getting longer and started getting shorter in geneva switzerland just before
00:03:05 christmas 1924 there was a secret meeting of top executives from the world's
00:03:11 leading light bulb companies phillips international general electric tokyo electric osram from germany and
00:03:16 the uk's associated electric among others they formed what became known
00:03:23 as the phoebus cartel named after phoebus the greek god of light there all these companies agreed to work together
00:03:32 to help each other by controlling the world's supply of light bulbs in the early days of the
00:03:38 electrical industry there had been lots of different small light bulb manufacturers but
00:03:43 by now they had largely been consolidated into these big corporations each dominant in a particular part of
00:03:50 the world the biggest threat they all faced was from longer lasting light bulbs for example in 1923 osram sold
00:03:59 63 million light bulbs but the following year they sold only 28 million light bulbs were lasting too long eating
00:04:06 into sales so all the companies in the cartel agreed to reduce the lifespan of their bulbs
00:04:14 to 1 000 hours cutting the existing average but how could each company ensure that the other companies would actually
00:04:22 follow the rules and make shorter lasting light bulbs after all it would be in each of their
00:04:28 individual interests to make a better product to outsell the others well to enforce the thousand
00:04:33 hour limit each of the manufacturers had to send in sample bulbs from their factories and they were tested on big test stands
00:04:40 like this one if a bulb lasted significantly longer than a thousand hours
00:04:47 well then the company was fined if a bulb lasted longer than three thousand hours well the fine was 200 swiss francs for every
00:04:55 thousand bulbs sold and there are records of these fines being issued to companies but how do you
00:05:02 make a worse light bulb in the first place well the same engineers who had previously been tasked with extending
00:05:07 the lifespan now had to find ways to decrease it so they tried
00:05:13 different materials different shaped filaments and thinner connections and if you look at the data they were successful
00:05:20 ever since the formation of the cartel the lifespan of light bulbs steadily decreased so that by 1934 the average lifespan was just
00:05:31 1205 hours and just as they had planned sales increased for cartel members by 25 in the four years after 1926
00:05:39 and even though the cost of components came down the cartel kept prices virtually unchanged so they increased
00:05:46 their profit margins so did people know that the light bulb companies were conspiring together to
00:05:52 make their products worse no the phoebus cartel claimed that its purpose was to
00:05:59 increase standardization and efficiency of light bulbs i mean they did establish this screw
00:06:03 thread as standard you can find it on virtually all light bulbs around the world now but all evidence
00:06:09 points to the cartels being motivated by profits and increased sales not by what was best for consumers
00:06:16 so one of the reasons this light bulb has lasted so long is because it was made before the cartel era
00:06:22 another reason is because the filament has always been run at low power
00:06:28 just four or five watts it was meant to be a night light for the fire station to provide just enough light so that firemen
00:06:35 wouldn't run into things at night and the fact that it was always on reduced the thermal cycling of the
00:06:39 filament and components limiting the stress caused by thermal expansion and contraction
00:06:46 the fibus cartel was initially planned to last at least until 1955 but it fell apart in the 1930s it was
00:06:54 already struggling due to outside competition and non-compliance amongst some of its members
00:06:59 but the outbreak of world war ii is really what finished it off so this cartel was dead but its methods
00:07:08 survived to this day there are lots of companies out there that intentionally shorten the lifespan
00:07:12 of their products it's a tactic known now as planned obsolescence this was actually the subject of casey
00:07:21 neistat's first viral video all the way back in 2003 thank you for calling apple my name is ryan may i have
00:07:27 your first name please casey all right what seems to be the issue today i have an
00:07:32 ipod that i bought about 18 months ago and the battery is dead on it 18 months okay it's passed it's here
00:07:38 which basically means for it'll there'll be a charge of 255 plus a mailing fee to send it to us to
00:07:45 read to refurbish to correct it but at that price you know you might as well go get a new one
00:07:53 this video got millions of views in a time before youtube or social media and it spawned a class class-action
00:08:00 lawsuit which apple settled out of court but it didn't stop the company from practicing planned obsolescence
00:08:07 after an ios update in 2017 users of older iphones found apps loading significantly slower or the
00:08:13 device shutting down altogether apple said they throttled performance to protect the battery
00:08:19 of older devices and increase their longevity of course that wouldn't be an issue if the battery were replaceable
00:08:26 in a series of lawsuits that concluded in 2020 apple was fined or reached settlements
00:08:31 to pay hundreds of millions of dollars undoubtedly this amount pales in comparison to the extra
00:08:37 revenue they generate by but some would argue that planned obsolescence isn't just about greed
00:08:49 but that it's also good for everyone during the great depression in the 1930s when as much as a quarter of americans
00:08:54 were out of work and american real estate broker bernard london proposed
00:09:00 mandatory planned obsolescence as a way to get people back to work and lift america out of the depression
00:09:05 he wrote i would have the government assign a lease of life to shoes and homes and machines when
00:09:11 they are first created and they would be sold and used within the term of their existence
00:09:17 definitely known by the consumer after the allotted time had expired these things would be
00:09:22 legally dead and would be controlled by the duly appointed governmental agency and destroyed if there is widespread unemployment
00:09:31 now this might sound like a wild fringe idea but people were clearly afraid of being put out of work by technological progress
00:09:39 and products that were too good there was even a popular oscar-nominated film about it this is
00:09:44 the man in the white suit from 1951 it's about a scientist who
00:09:51 invents the perfect fiber it won't stain or break or fray i think i've succeeded in the
00:09:55 copolymerization of amino acid residues and carbohydrate molecules both containing ionic groups it's really
00:10:02 perfectly simple the academy award nomination was for best screenplay
00:10:09 i kid you not anyway everyone is initially excited about our hero's scientific discovery
00:10:15 he makes a suit out of the thread and it has to be white because the fiber is so stain resistant it can't even be dyed
00:10:22 but this is when trouble strikes the factory owners realize they won't be able to sell as
00:10:27 much of this thread because it's so durable and the workers worry it'll put them out of a job well i got you
00:10:36 scientists leave things alone what about my bitter washing when there's no washing to do
00:10:42 this is when you get the climactic scene where factory workers and factory owners team up to chase down the scientist to
00:10:48 destroy him and his invention and believe it or not this movie may have been
00:10:56 inspired by real events in the 1940s the synthetic fiber nylon replaced silk in stockings and it was so durable
00:11:02 that the products became an overnight sensation there were literal riots when women tried to get their hands on them
00:11:10 when the manufacturers realized they had made the product too good they didn't destroy the fiber
00:11:16 but they did follow the example of the phoebus cartel they instructed their engineers and
00:11:21 scientists to find ways to weaken the product to shorten its lifespan so people would have to buy more
00:11:28 now it seems like consumers are finally fighting back against planned obsolescence in the european union and in over 25
00:11:34 states in the u.s there's proposed legislation to enshrine the right to repair
00:11:40 these laws would force manufacturers to make it easier to repair their products they would have to
00:11:45 provide information and access to parts so you could replace a battery or fix a cracked screen at a third party repair
00:11:52 shop without voiding your warranty so if the right to repair does become law does that mean artificial
00:11:59 obsolescence will be gone for good sadly no because there is one last thing manufacturers can use to make their products
00:12:10 henry ford released the first mass-market car the model t in 1908 and he envisioned it like a workhorse
00:12:17 an affordable tool that wouldn't wear out a bit like the everlasting light bulb in 1922 ford said
00:12:24 we want the man who buys one of our cars never to have to buy another we never make an improvement that
00:12:29 renders any previous model obsolete but by 1920 55 of american families already owned a car
00:12:38 nearly everyone that could afford one had one and that same year there was a small
00:12:43 economic downturn driving down sales for both ford and general motors in 1921
00:12:51 dupont the chemical and paint company took over the controlling share in general motors
00:12:55 and they started experimenting with painting cars different colors up until then henry ford had said you
00:13:01 could have whatever color you like so long as it's black it took a couple years of testing but in 1924
00:13:09 gm released their first cars in different colors and soon after they introduced a trick
00:13:13 that feels very familiar now each new year they would introduce
00:13:20 cars in different colors the goal wasn't just to make ford's model t look outdated but to make their
00:13:27 own cars feel outdated every year encouraging customers to trade in their old cars for shiny new ones
00:13:34 years later gm's head of design harley earl candidly discussed his role in creating what he called
00:13:40 dynamic obsolescence our big job is to hasten obsolescence in 1934 the average car ownership span was five years
00:13:50 now which was 1955 it is two years when it is one year we will have a perfect score
00:13:56 by the time he said this general motors was the most valuable company in the world and it sold half of all vehicles
00:14:02 purchased in the u.s every year these days the world's most valuable
00:14:10 company apple seems to have copied directly out of this playbook i mean new styles every year
00:14:17 check new special colors every year check marginal technological improvement check i mean is this
00:14:25 useful innovation or just a gimmick the inspiration for general motors and hence for apple comes from
00:14:31 fashion where real innovation is all but impossible so the only way to make people feel the urgency to get out there
00:14:37 and buy is to create styles that last but one season the trouble then is you run through
00:14:44 these styles too quickly and then what are you supposed to do we'll just recycle the styles from a few
00:14:49 decades ago the iphone also shows this recycling trend i mean just look at the way the edges
00:14:56 were initially rounded and then they were squared off and then they were rounded again
00:15:01 and now they're squared off and how much do you want to bet that the iphone 14 has rounded edges i think the point is that
00:15:09 with design and styling there is no best there's only different which is apparently enough to remind us
00:15:14 that we don't have the latest and greatest and so we have to rush out and keep buying the only type of obsolescence we
00:15:21 should support is technological which brings us back to the light bulb
00:15:27 you know in the last 20 years light bulbs have gone from incandescent which was basically
00:15:32 unchanged for 100 years to compact fluorescent and now to led these use just a tenth of the energy and
00:15:40 can last anywhere from 10 to 50 times longer yeah that's pretty bright so you're more likely
00:15:49 to sell your house than to have to replace an led bulb that you've installed inside it so we've finally
00:15:55 reached the point of what is essentially an everlasting hey this video was sponsored by nordvpn
00:16:10 you know i am featured in an episode of the british tv program qi it's a show i really like and i'd
