00:00:05  in December 2020, I flew to the Hawaiian island of oahu and toured it  up and down there is everything that your heart desires an ocean of waves and surfing volcanoes  whales awesome hiking trails and more
00:00:16  in short, so as not to repeat yourself, look at the release of this island, everything is in  the details of the soil sit short conclusion is bad then this is such a sample in Hawaiian  islands but the case of Hawaii was not limited to one island here very much
00:00:27  inhabited islands and I thought for a long time where they are the stunning island of kauai  beautiful true but unfortunately now it is completely closed for visiting there is no  if you enter there is another interesting island not how but it will not be possible to see not
00:00:50  in time to species not even after to species because this island is basically closed  public case with them while i even show you  nothing since the video from this island is extremely difficult to find on the Internet.
00:01:01  the unofficial name of the forbidden island is almost impossible to get here on  they and he do not have shops for roads, cars or telephone services  but about 200 people live here, these are indigenous Hawaiians who almost never
00:01:13  contacts with the outside world imagine this still exists today  America it would be very interesting to look at this island unfortunately  it is simply impossible to get in shorter, as it turned out, I had very little choice and
00:01:38  you will not believe, but in order for the sound of you to be gone, the island I had to do again  coffee test it was the fastest most painless to the kind test ever and now  guess how much it cost me 50 100 no 314 dollars 14 cents in the past
00:01:52  times for that kind of money it was possible to fly in Turkey on the front, in general, this  was the most expensive trip in the whole history of my solo travels and I decided  I understand that this car is probably too cool for me, but it's not so much mine
00:02:12  whim how much production is necessary  ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the big island as you probably already  guessed from the name this is the largest island of the entire Hawaiian archipelago and
00:02:27  besides, he is the youngest, we will pass all his interesting places but  while a little rest in general rest long trips very  an important thing especially when being away from home you don't have
00:02:39  there are troubling questions such as the tap is flowing for the house for me, or  wiring and sho there in general with an apartment, but there is one proven tool that  will save you from such worries it is called ajax ajax
00:02:50  this is a professional wireless security system that I have been doing for another year  so one and a half ago I installed my studio here and I can tell you that this is very  convenient and very cool thing which, in principle, me and your attitude to
00:03:01  the safety of your belongings, this system can be installed anywhere  in the office in the apartment in the house in the store and in his absence with the help of just  one application to monitor everything at once and I will send a notification if somewhere
00:03:12  burst the pipe, a fire will start or someone will try to get through the door to you  or through the window if you install the machine is a motion sensor with a camera then  after the alarm you will receive a series of photos to quickly assess the situation
00:03:25  is it a burglar or just a cleaning lady my favorite feature is management  sockets using the phone and they can not only be turned off remotely  but also programming to turn on at a certain time is very cool and well,
00:03:37  the main acquisition for owners of a fresh repair is this leakage sensor  elix protect you can install a ligament solenoid valve during the repair phase  littered about that ax and in the event of a flood, at least the Hawaiians cut off the water from the mobile
00:03:50  applications follow the link in the description to order a starter kit  ajax and receive a leakage sensor whether x protect a gift and give them conceived  say I rented myself a room in a guest house in
00:04:00  in the town of hilo on the eastern part of the island you want a joke I just appear  settles in this half a mistress does not ask and you feel an earthquake  I say what winter 3 he says well, like this afternoon 3 6 points
00:04:15  our windows shook and this happens here on the big island quite  often in 2017, this happened every  day 2018, there was a strong eruption of the volcano Kilauea, one of the
00:04:29  the most active volcanoes on the planet until 2018, it erupted continuously for  35 years old but now this volcano is sleeping and in it  the crater formed a small lake so that the earthquake that occurred during the day
00:04:41  was somewhat strange, but the owner of the guesthouse, Diana, assured me that it was  complete nonsense and this happens to  but let's not talk about alkanes for now, it's better I'll tell you about the place in which
00:05:33  settled in this guest house a rather interesting party gathered my neighbor  room to improve my health to get my dose of vitamins arrived  here by car from Alaska. and I understand him very well in big
00:05:46  sharp all year round the abundance of different fruits that grow right on your  backyard and every day the hostess for breakfast rolled a huge plate out of  oranges, bananas in pairs and something else I have not identified
00:05:58  but it is very tasty to warn their grandmother, she says the granddaughter died in the garden  fresh rationed narva for breakfast about the same on the big island  the only problem with this town is the strong humidity, the wind blows here from
00:06:12  the sides of the ocean are clouds and as a result, it rains almost constantly  so the only option to see something was to leave Hilo that I  actually made by the way rainbows on the big island probably even more than
00:06:24  for Allah in winter to come to the big island is  most of all because there are about ten climatic zones, that is, even if in  one part of the island and pouring rain on the other one hundred percent street
00:06:41  now a few words directly about the island  it is formed by the top of 5 large shield volcanoes and it can be very roughly said that  the big island is one hefty mountain sticking out of
00:06:51  ocean so all the roads here go down to the water and when you go by car and  this is of course very beautiful by the way, one more point that needs to be mentioned  This is that in Hawaii, billboards are banned everywhere.
00:07:04  adds a few points to the beauty of any road you take  you move as nothing interferes with the view when it comes to roads  then I found a couple of cool routes here that go right through
00:07:15  local jungle the feeling of driving is like driving through a greenhouse due to  a large amount of precipitation on the western part of the island, about three of them fall  meters a year with greenery here everything is in perfect order as well as with waterfalls but local
00:07:28  the highlight is still not waterfalls, but beaches with black sand for example punalu  beach is one of the most famous black beaches  and not only in Hawaii, but in general in the world, he is constantly included in all sorts of ratings
00:07:39  along with the big beach, which has already been seen with you in Iceland, but unlike  Islamic beach where you can swim only in a wetsuit in Hawaiian  swim I don’t want sand that covers everything
00:07:50  from volcanic minerals and lava fragments and since it is really black this  the beach heats up in the sun more than usual than the locals enjoy  resident Hawaiian green turtles who are surrounded by butterflies sunbathe
00:08:01  specially designated places in general in Hawaii you can swim in  surrounded by turtles but on this beach they are so lazy that they do not swim a  just drifting in coastal waters just like me in life
00:08:14  one of the most beautiful points of the southern part of the island is perhaps the valley  vape oh but not everything is so easy with her  located below and to get to it you need to go down the old and very
00:08:26  steep road with an average slope of 25 degrees, you can call here  only on off-road vehicles on ordinary sedans, spu is strictly prohibited but for this  i took a full natural jeep to go down this slope to be honest
00:08:37  a little dumb at night to do in the valley as you understand, you can go down and  on foot but this is not our method all that will happen next  called the magic of cinema, it will seem to you that this is a completely ordinary road, but
00:08:49  Believe me, she is very, very cool, both literally and figuratively before  medium condé forces 25 degrees but in some areas  it reaches as much as 45 and this very specifically fills the horizon, add here more
00:09:03  the fact that the road is very narrow and you have to skip transport every now and then  which goes up in general it was a very exciting ride  by the way, this is the steepest road in the usa and on some sections
00:09:14  she's the coolest famous baldwin street with new zealand's coolest streets in the world  in the final section, this road to the valley drops 250 meters in height less than  for 1 kilometer of the route, in general, you go down rather quickly, and when
00:09:27  you get downstairs you understand why jack was needed here  but all this effort is definitely worth it  not
00:10:00  this is what the viper valley looks like, these rocks rise more than 600 meters and  the valley is home to the highest waterfall in hawaii, sickly falls, the water falls here  from 300 meters high, the viper valley is a sacred site in Hawaiian history and
00:10:16  never home to thousands of indigenous Hawaiians who grew taro plants  now about 100 people live here, but taro plantations are still in place  chilo but heelas piled robust so it was decided to move to another
00:10:35  part of the island is here as it is to Allah very much  abrupt climate change, you first drive rain and then into fog and then sky  brightens and you see the sun again and all this in less than half an hour the road that
00:10:48  leads to another part of the island passes between the two highest volcanoes  the ender is running up here a great height is very windy so we do not waste time  and we go down for another 40 minutes and we are with you on the western
00:11:00  parts of a large island, the sun almost always shines here and therefore in  the car suddenly appeared unnecessary parts  now this car is at least a little more like a microbe the main city is this
00:11:18  part of the island is called kona, I made plans for it, but it turned out that  almost in vain, firstly, the local landscapes can hardly be called  a delight for the eyes around almost only one lava and several beaches
00:11:29  true with real white sand, which is rare on the island, however, a few  interesting things I still found here the first coffee in my life I couldn't porridge  to think that in America they make coffee because it's America, then everything turns out to be
00:11:43  they still do yes, this is such a surprise leg life grows coffee and all because of a very  interesting combination of climate here and a hefty mountain on the horizon is a volcano  its name in Hawaiian sounds like a line from a song by the band Lyapis Trubetskoy
00:11:55  wa la lai here it is very clear that on  coast con and great weather and sunny and it rains on the mountain that is  the climate on the slope of the volcano is more humid and these are good conditions for growing coffee
00:12:06  which is what the locals use to grow one hundred percent Hawaiian coffee  the second interesting story is directly related to the city of kona  the fact is that every year probably the most famous championship is held here in
00:12:18  the world of triathlon called ironman iron man then perhaps not  knowing this size it is a race that includes almost 4 kilometers of swimming  one hundred and eight kilometers on a bike and a marathon distance in running and important
00:12:30  say that all these disciplines go one after another, that is, all this happens in  one day the ironman is considered one of the most  difficult one-day competitions in and around the world has long been formed
00:12:40  a certain kui if suddenly you have friends a triathlete does not just have a friend  which runs the ironman blank otherwise you should know that it is completely shifted  in fact, people, that is, there is even such
00:12:50  saying that a triathlete at home says this to a family but in a good way in general  when there is a district all the streets are packed with people because  a huge amount of support comes and is absolutely amazing
00:13:02  energy I have not only heard, I have never seen it and this year how  you understand the exchange that takes place here in October was also canceled  due to the coronavirus epidemic, unfortunately, this is where my story about horses ends
00:13:16  look turned out to be practically nothing, so we move on to your  the island, as well as on wah, I had several interesting  very unexpected meetings with my acquaintances, and by the way, it seemed to me
00:13:26  here I have a bank of springs in my hands, so I decided to introduce a new heading  she is called an acquaintance who stepped in hawaii, we do not know how  quite by accident a scanner or with a friend of mine growing up for installation in Kiev and he
00:13:38  straight noble traveler traveled more countries even than I traveled rostik  that 13 countries and he is a great example of how you can travel from not very  big budget and travel is always very budget as far as I understand and
00:13:49  I can put under the bridge, but I also have such a format on and  usually there three days hardcore one glamor three days you go with a tent somewhere sleeping  it is not clear where then for a day or two you are resting in some hotel
00:14:03  ler bingley decently that is, it's not even a question of money, absolutely this is the format  knowledge of the place, that is, you yourself do not understand that one thing is a page in a hotel  it's another matter to become on couchsurfing to immediately understand the culture from the inside, that is
00:14:16  my principle of travel is to stop being a tourist just from the ladder  the plane in the new place is very cool, so we take this quote on  arms growth invited me to a rather unusual place this
00:14:28  a kind of cross between a Balinese retreat and a community of enlightened people who  live here doing yoga spiritual practices or are not on  self-sufficiency as you understand most of the vegetarians here, so with
00:14:40  nutritional problems do not arise especially besides here it is really very  beautifully right on the territory you can feed the peacocks lizards and get  luli from geese who are here as a security service
00:14:51  one of the residents of this community, Igor, showed us his home and you only  look at this house in the jungle in all this he made with his own hands and in  the house was found a large number of musical instruments including even
00:15:15  Slavic a little later it turned out that almost everyone I met in this retreat  speak Russian and in general Andy ran over a rather large Russian-speaking community  to understand the reasons for all this, I asked for a visit to the bathtub which
00:15:26  lives near con and he built a big house here and his family is also not  little wife and five children please tell me  I'm just 10 why there is such a large Russian-speaking community here
00:15:39  running for I think this is what is cheaper here the rent was cheaper and the house in general  buy it was possible to keep a member wahu or small well how  there is land here you can here some proof of the phone to an expensive place
00:15:57  Kaunas in having a small town and a shtamba is more expensive on average somewhere around 300 thousand  plot of land plot of land thousand here is our plot 1 a car mod we bought for 300  that on the south on the common vetom city an acre of land is the same as mine will cost
00:16:14  15 thousand seriously, but the prices went up and it was possible to buy for 5000 why  so cheap because there is nothing there just a piece of wowa basis  another of the big reasons why it's not cheap there is lava zoom they have
00:16:30  it is considered highways lava zones remember this term in the future it will come in handy  if again a volcano then they can flood most of all, then they do not give it more interesting  at home many banks do not give loans.She is at home because highways
00:16:50  but the next day I went to see the area I was talking about  ivan this is how the settlement looks like india on a big island here really  ocean view but the good news ends there
00:17:01  before the ointment builds directly on the lava that once went down the slopes of the volcano  mauna loa and despite the potential danger they continue to build here  the hope that the eruption will no longer be as long as the area is lucky but lucky
00:17:15  on the big island, unfortunately, not everyone, to show this I came to  the area called Leilani states visually it seems that this is the most  usual area but it is not quite usual and now you will understand why
00:17:33  this once beautiful village now in places resembles the underworld many  roads or dead ends pass further  forbidden from afar it seems that some hills begin there but this is not
00:17:47  all the hills are craters and volcanic cracks that have formed here in  as a result of the eruption of volcano Kilauea in 2018, all these waste heaps grew  right in the middle of the streets of Laylani estates huge swathes of the area
00:18:01  were flooded with lava despite the fact that enough had passed  a lot of time underground here it is still hot and the park that currency is met  a vivid reminder of this and now the most interesting in lilani states is still
00:18:14  people live and plots are still sold here  to understand what it is like to live in ailani pinworms, imagine what you have in the back  the courtyard next to the pool has its own small
00:18:23  a volcano that can erupt at any time  this is how people live here we get it now when we are here I want you  we looked at the footage that was filmed there are two slopes of the year ago
00:18:37  This footage was shot by Brian Lauri from a helicopter at the end of May 2018 at  the territory of the settlement of Lilani and the states formed two dozen volcanic  cracks that were filled with lava all around the most famous crack number eight
00:18:51  which was located on luana street produced a huge fountain of lava  hitting 100 meters up this molten mass descended down to  moving the ocean at an average speed of 74 meters
00:19:03  for an hour she burned the roads, trees there, but in general, everything that came across on the way  peak moments this area suffered about 400 earthquakes in 24 hours  most of Taiwan's states were wiped out
00:19:18  200 houses but fortunately no one died  during my trip to the big island, I met with Alexey Lyosha  one of those who lost their home here is the road he used to drive every day
00:19:34  now it ends in long black moscow  this belief  Lyosha's family for the first time in a long time came to see the place where
00:20:03  once stood their house  it is almost impossible to determine its exact location now everything  covered with a thick layer of solidified lava we have not climbed there yet we bought land and we
00:20:24  did not know that this is chapter 1 chapter 2 head of zones van in english i am so head of zone 1  this means that under the ground, lava always flows directly into the ocean, we did not know this  what does it mean in the flowerpot 1st why here
00:20:41  the plot was cheaper than other places because such nature is so beautiful  and as cheaply as not to buy and then it would be when  Zhilova flowed, we understood what amazon is one, it means any moment
00:20:56  can you go to the land and take everything, well, I think it was worth the risk we are not we are not  we regret nothing that we bought it here how long we lived here we bought in  in the fourteenth year of the eighteenth the volcano took all
00:21:15  if you forget about these black melts for a second, then the place is really  very beautiful to the ocean just 7 minutes by car children also liked hot  the sources were of a range so I think it was worth it we we were building
00:21:35  and we had a very large living room kitchen strap toilet and a large awning  we were also built on bought material, the purpose of the loop was in debt, we left at that time  when we were in the con, we had a universelle woman with a sphere, the graph needed them
00:22:01  and when we went there to rest and on the news we saw that there are words  started and when we realized that we could pick up some things and we  when they returned to lowered another couple to pick up things and then to one of the
00:22:20  these times, the police just water but all these services drove us out of there  because the crack began on the road and the cracks began to grow more and more they  good glass in another place, but not yet flowed around us, and when to put these things but
00:22:39  cracks grow, they evacuated us, they did not allow us to return anything  pick up and did not see any more merit and did not see it again on the 17th, we found out  that the house was already covered, it was hard for my wife to tell because she was
00:22:56  still had some hope that it would still remain  it is worth adding that Lyosha Vera bought a new house, although he is also in  the zone of potential damage of the volcano Kilauea of ​​this vazon 3 is not a word zone
00:23:11  1 that is, the new amazon magazine has all the lava zones here, it's just that it's less sickly here  this city is all lava zones 3 so we are kind of exposed but not as before  Lyosha test me on the beach, I did not like to spend time with the whole family
00:23:34  but now it bears little resemblance to the beach that was here before May 2018 in order to  it was clearer how this place looked before the eruption, just look at Google  the map has not been updated and it is very clear there that there was a real beach
00:23:49  there was a special place for launching the boat and now, due to the eruption  Kilauea volcano 2018, the landscape of the island has changed forever  for this reason, it is easy to calculate the exact area began in da
00:24:12  impossible because she is constantly changing for the same reason says this  the only US state whose territory is slowly but surely increasing  and all because of the eruptions that were and are likely to occur in
00:24:25  near future barge on the big island active  volcanoes here will continue to appear such black rocks black  the beach that a person will try somehow
00:24:35  adapt for yourself, but it turned out that my story with alkanes on a large  the island on this did not end the next morning on December 21, 2020 I  I just lie in bed, open a news site and see it
00:24:52  [applause] I was located yesterday at 10 pm Lent  very tired but 10-30 there was an earthquake of 4 points and right now there started  erupting a volcano for locals is probably usually the case, but I'm just shocked
00:25:09  I am suppliers that did not manage to be here at this very moment shorter than a leg in  hands have to go along the path and saw this huge cloud that was visible  the state of many kilometers means the next story is this volcano it
00:25:31  called kilauea it's a local celebrity because here  did business before this but in 2017 he did not show any signs of activity  that is, I was going to tell the real one that I had arrived and, as it were, no
00:25:43  activity did not live in some kind of lava it is impossible to remove and here I am on you for now  I don’t understand if I can get to the national park, they will come to us sooner too  in all, it should not be closed to visitors
00:26:04  but how less should all be seen by their own  eyes in general, the story develops live on both Yandex and  to my surprise, the volcano park was not closed, I met several
00:26:17  rangers but got inside without any problems and was among the first to come here  clouds of volcanic gas were hanging over the parking lot and this is what I saw  hello this is your predator from plant and on top dushkin straight from the scene I'm like
00:26:42  that I missed everything because everything happened at night here inside the crater  there was water that mixed with glory, it turned out to be an explosion like this all this  looks like
00:26:56  on my arrival at the site already worked TV crew of a well-known channel  here I met Brian Lauri as a professional volcanic photographer  who photographed all the eruptions of volcano Kilauea since 91 Brian
00:27:08  logit site lava peak where you can see photos of battles on  the big island and there are more than a thousand  expects deduction of the element to the floor muzzle from the crater of the volcano Kilauea
00:27:58  huge about a kilometer in diameter and the encoder is even larger in some places  it reaches a width of 2 and a half miles, which is about four kilometers all  this is the result and the many images that continuously occurred here in
00:28:11  in recent years, Kilauea is a shield volcano; visually, it is very different from  volcano in a conical shape, which we are used to seeing as the famous  flag is capable of erupting several times a day, throwing out lava and
00:28:28  volcanic bombs shield volcanoes can't show this  show, but they have their own advantages, for example, you can look into the crater  volcano this is how the crater of Kilauea looked a few days after the eruption
00:28:41  the huge black mass below is a lava lake more than 100 meters deep.  fills and will continue to fill with lava from  two volcanic cracks in the crater in February 2021, the depth of this lake
00:28:54  has already reached 216 meters and it will continue to grow  in short, what is happening now is a great success, everyone tells me that I am  damn lucky but in general I actually came to this national park by
00:29:08  for one big reason, because his example can be used to explain how in general  appeared speak and now if you do not mind  a little bit of dialogue and a big stop where we are now
00:29:19  the volcanic island is the second largest in the world only Iceland is larger than it  over there in the corner of priceline I once told a big issue if that  look so volcanic islands appear thanks to the volcano oni sochi
00:29:30  appears where there are some sulfur pride on this map, these joints are highlighted  in dark blue, just along this border pass the so-called  pacific ring of fire is 328 out of 500 40 of all active
00:29:42  There are many volcanoes on earth and they are far from this zone.  in the center of the lithospheric plates, how did they appear, the fact is that  in the center of the Pacific lithospheric plate is the so-called Hawaiian
00:29:54  hot. if very roughly then this is a huge mass of magma that rises  to the surface of the earth, it is a high temperature furnace and smelted  Hawaiian islands and the principle of operation is similar to this night light, which is popularly
00:30:05  called a lava lamp, incandescent magma rises from the core  surface lithospheric plates burning tandoor and creates volcanoes here  hot. here is the pacific lithospheric plates
00:30:16  hot. does not move anywhere on stands still the plate moves and with the help of this  hotspot on this plate is formed by islands  if you look at the map, you can see the trajectory along which the Hawaiian
00:30:27  hotspot burned hawaii on the lithospheric plate of the island located  one after another kind of chain and the last as the youngest is a big island  the process of its formation is happening right now in front of our eyes there
00:30:40  In the crater of Kilauea volcano, building materials rise to the surface of the earth  which will increase the area of ​​the island therefore volcanoes, although they cause  evil to man, but at the same time they do great geological deeds, but let's return to
00:30:53  the first site is a lot of tourists now, in fact, there is nothing yet  happens, I think that the right decision would be to come here in the evening and  So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Sunset Evening Kilauea Show here at
00:31:06  How many times are extra low than during the day and the lake illuminates the smoke from the crater and from the side  it seems that this is such a gateway to the underworld  in the evening of the lookout, hundreds of tourists gathered and everyone naturally needs
00:31:17  there was a photo with a bow even though you seem to be on  a safe distance and this thing is, well, far away, but it all looks like at night  straight as sinister as possible I can only imagine that
00:31:30  saw the people who came here first after the eruption here it was straight  real devilish fishing, I decided to make a little hack what to see  another point because there is not enough parking for everyone, but our quality
00:31:46  Americans are the ultimate handsome men, everything is beautifully sorted out here  parking attendants found parking spaces in general by professionals but most importantly  hayko time is heaven in principle and light is not needed
00:31:57  because his king from the volcano illuminates non-being, the principle can be seen where  these  while padga you will be a hot spot that feeds the volcano and they will
00:32:09  continue to grow but over time the Pacific plate that moves  move these islands farther from the hearth and they begin to cool down and collapse and how  consequence to dive into the ocean under its own weight and we have
00:32:21  about 10 million years to see them because after that  period here in this place most likely there will be no islands  but 10 million years is not such a short time, so I hope that all
00:32:36  did so for this whole story as a large island but one final  chord sun set of a beautiful place naturally with a place I have long been  the actual part was determined for the sake of this place and I flew to the big one for everything
00:32:48  for this we need warm clothes, an all-wheel drive car and as much as possible  more oxygen drove  it's time to tell where we are going our goal is this peak
00:33:02  on the horizon it is not only the highest peak  Hawaiian islands but also the highest mountain on our planet  if you count the height from the ocean floor, it is called mauna-kea
00:33:12  and as you might have guessed, this is also the shield volcano mauna-kea is not  only the highest mountain on the harbor but the place you are there is probably the most  world famous astronomical observatory
00:33:25  it is located at an altitude of more than four kilometers above sea level  therefore, in order to get there, it is imperative to make the installation shorter than this  the mountain is so high that in order to go there to the top
00:33:35  it is necessary to acclimatize here at an altitude of 2800 meters and this process  will be done by everyone who goes up there, even scientists who work on mauna-kea for  acclimatization here for good you need to spend at least an hour I neglected
00:33:48  to check these standards here for 10 minutes for which subsequently the network paid for  in fact, everything is serious enough since at the top there is an observatory on  the entrance is a ranger who asks you where are you from to record all your
00:34:00  contact details because the number of places on the top is limited therefore  in fact, I was so early and arrived one more nuance to the top of the start only on  four-wheel drive cars, but this question was decided at the very beginning of his
00:34:11  travel and now about the important and the roads to mauna kea  this road is just dastish fantastish mauna kea so high that the clouds and  your problems remain somewhere down there and you see with the feeling that you are conquering
00:34:38  some kind of new peak for myself damn, I cannot convey in words how beautiful it is  climb to 4200 meters almost from sea level  unit nuance is that there was hilo plus 27
00:35:06  and here on mauna-kea + 6 so let's get warm  and let's see what's what's here, so we are on mauna-kea here  the observatory of the same name which has a total of 13
00:35:22  telescopes belonging to 11 different countries to create very briefly why  the disk you built right here, well, first of all, on mauna kea, it is always practically  the weather is always good we will repent by learning the altitude and the clouds are usually lower
00:35:36  us secondly, there is a very clean atmosphere, that is, remoteness  civilization the air is very clean 3 there is no light pollution I am in this  will tell you lived in australia 2 4 here very low humidity and very good so
00:35:50  called 100 magical vision here they say turbulence is shorter if briefly  this is almost an ideal place for observing the starry sky in general in  the world, and besides ideal conditions for astronomy, it is also
00:36:06  and a very beautiful place as it is the highest mountain in Hawaii and the mountains as  usually this is a sacred place for locals, then the locals are naturally very  they rebel strongly that there is some kind of construction going on here, especially after
00:36:20  of how they decided to build here on mauna kea  kente telescope 30-meter telescope in the world's largest  in general, the wild catavasia began, the Hawaiians stood up to protect the mountain
00:36:33  sort out the campground walked with banners for not even fit  Jason Momoa who hails from here gets beaten in general while this is  the telescope was suspended, I do not know what it has to do only with the offensive
00:36:45  local residents, either from the fact that money is needed for it  very, very much as for the maintenance of other telescopes  these high-tech machines with mirror diameters from 1 to 25 meters
00:36:56  requires constant cooling to very low temperatures and operation 1  a telescope a year can cost tens of millions of dollars telescopes for  mauna kea looks extremely futuristic and there are even celebrities among them
00:37:09  for example telescopes keck yes that's the real name so astronomers too  It turns out that key card telescopes have long been considered the largest in  the world, but then they were outstripped by a large telescope in the Canary Islands.
00:37:22  Konstantin Batygin works in one of these observatories who you may know  from the issue here I'm talking about Konstantin Batygin and, in fact, this person is one of  co-authors of theories about the 9th planet Kostya works on
00:37:35  Japanese telescope subaru but during filming he was at home  at home, so we talked via video link, these few everyday issues I spent  on the mountain and about two o'clock and I was forced to go down because I
00:37:47  physically it was very difficult to be like you are the people that I ask you to spend there  well a lot of time how do you deal with miners  and is it possible for me to cope and accustomed to all this means the next process we
00:37:59  first we climb 10,000 feet from where we went in fact and where is this center  for visors you have to sleep there and only after 48 hours can we go we can  in fact, I always have a problem with driving around the third hour
00:38:21  for 1 first night it's not yes they just kind of stay tired local  we give up, that is, when trivial things that need to be done on a telescope like  press the up button twice then press enter i forget how many times
00:38:39  pressed and I just completely shut off the brain then the first couple of nights this  on oxygen but then get used to just say  here the clock is just basic for people who do not understand at all, including
00:38:53  me, what discoveries were made with the help of the telescope located on  milk, in principle, there are a lot of them, for example  Belev prize this year was given to a group of people who worked on
00:39:11  andj gates galaxy center bills professor she used just like  when as soon as he was still then completely Polish from the young and she used  to prove that there is a super massive black hole at the center of the galaxy
00:39:28  while building and maintaining these telescopes costs billions  dollars and they may never pay off  they will pay off what to call they will pay off in something that is difficult
00:39:42  to convert currency to look for a job I will get it because we  there they found something, any of this is precisely from the category of us knowledge that  very, very really important and they really like said even they are out of shape I forget
00:40:03  as the chunks said but they are useful they are useful and at the same time they are absolutely useless  the results of investments that were buried here in 11 countries, we are unlikely to be able to  touch but perhaps knowledge is obtained and in these observatories there was once a way of life
00:40:21  to our descendants, so this is a long-term investment of oxygen kapets as not  it's very difficult for me to speak, but to be honest, I just excited you because  that I dreamed of getting to this place for ten years since I watched films
00:40:37  about astrophysics and about the Kek observatory in general, now what will happen is what I do  waited a long time for the sun set on mauna kea and then did not take pictures and the starry sky  a man going down is rising I'm wildly cold and spinning very much
00:41:37  head due to altitude sickness but they also do not give  here for tourists to stay after sunset because in America if this headlight is in  general light pollution, but in fact, below from under and we
00:41:51  of course now we will stop there and see what the starry sky looks like above  mauna kea forgive me for this slurred speech without oxygen was well, right at all  bad, but as soon as I went downstairs, the camera became much easier.
00:42:04  set it remains now only to wait in the case of astrophotography find out usually  it takes long enough to make these short videos I had to  wait about two hours but the results were
00:42:17  far from ideal in the first place, not everything was good in terms of shooting conditions, but during  second, as Kostya said on the mountain, I was a little dull, but something interesting  I still managed to capture a look at the lower left corner you will find out
00:42:31  This is our old friend, the volcano Kilauea, illuminates the clouds with its crater  which reflect the bright light of lava the idea with astrophotography was actually here  failed a little because firstly, the moon shines brightly in the sky, and secondly
00:42:44  the car is constantly driving there is light and the air temperature, to be honest, is up to 34  degrees so not super comfortable so let's see how it looks  peak fullness at night
00:43:02  such a starry sky above the summit that night and unfortunately did not see it, but here  sunset on mauna kea was definitely shortlisted for the most memorable of all  time before I have my final say on Hawaii very
00:43:15  short ad i finally got my own  merchandise if you want to know what it means and where to buy it all see the link in  description and now what really is everything here will be very simple, I think that
00:43:28  you saw everything yourself and of course if there is an opportunity at least once in your life  fly to hawaii this is one hundred percent you need to do here there is a lot  unique things but I actually travel the islands with a different thought about
00:43:40  it may seem very seditious modern varnish of this period, but I  nevertheless, I voiced a very thought that it’s how easy it was to travel, the meaning is  that when I was preparing for the release I read the history of the Hawaiian Islands in general people
00:43:55  still there a hundred years ago, maybe even a little more there were already travelers currency  what to get to Hawaii will need to be carried out on a ship  on the ship for several months people could not know there get infected die along the way
00:44:08  well, in general, it was wildly difficult now even in such a remote place as hawaii  really the other end of the world, well, a day and a half, maybe you can fly and  in a day to actually manage and it's just like that compared to the fact that
00:44:23  it was a hundred years ago and now the traveler has everything a hotel  there is a gps navigator no maps are needed in general, again I will say again now this  contradictory phrase we just get it right never before traveling
