00:00:02 sure having a mansion is a sign of wealth and owning a private jet lets everyone know that you're rolling in the
00:00:08 dough but there's one thing that rises above all else when it comes to luxury and that's owning your very own private island
00:00:16 lounging in the sun with a drink in hand miles away from the nearest person may sound like a dream
00:00:24 but it's a pricey one today we're going to take a look at how much it actually costs and search for an
00:00:29 answer to the big question is owning a private island actually worth it
00:00:34 the first big expanse of buying a private island is quite obviously purchasing the island itself
00:00:41 sure you have fantasies about cabanas in the white sand and maybe even a golf course on the
00:00:46 north side of the island but all that starts with finding the perfect location to build a foundation on
00:00:53 and make those dreams a reality that being said the cost of your island varies
00:00:57 drastically depending on where you buy in canada for example which has the highest
00:01:03 number of private islands for sale in the world you can get islands for under two
00:01:08 hundred thousand dollars and if you're really pinching pennies well you can even scoop up an island for just
00:01:15 under a hundred thousand dollars take this island in nova scotia called half island for just 65 000
00:01:23 less than half the cost of your average home you can buy this six acre island that's located less than a mile
00:01:29 away from the mainland however that price comes with a catch sure 65 000 is great for your own little
00:01:37 slice of paradise in the summer at least in winter temperatures around
00:01:43 half island can reach as low as negative 22 degrees fahrenheit the island is only feasible
00:01:48 to live on during summer and even during the summer getting supplies
00:01:53 can be a hassle when you're thinking of a private island chances are you're not thinking of cold
00:01:57 remote locations you're thinking locations with sandy beaches and palm trees
00:02:03 where flip-flops are considered formal attire likely you're picturing the caribbean made up
00:02:07 of thousands of islands with hills sprawling sand beaches and crystal clear waters the caribbean
00:02:15 is a breathtaking location to build the tropical oasis of your dreams and there are plenty of
00:02:21 islands to pick from surprisingly the prices aren't actually that overwhelming
00:02:27 either if you're settling for a smaller chunk of land that's more remote you can snag an
00:02:32 island for between one and three million dollars but if you're looking for a larger island in the more popular
00:02:39 desirable areas of the caribbean well that price can be anywhere between 30 to 100 million dollars
00:02:46 some of the popular island chains include the exumas the abaco islands and the berry islands
00:02:52 islands in these chains in particular offer an advantage that remote islands don't they're close to bigger towns
00:02:59 in cities which eases access for visiting guests and owners take for example spectabilis island in
00:03:07 the axiumus the island stretches 460 acres which includes dozens of white sand beaches scenic hilltop views
00:03:15 and plenty of potential building space and it's only 230 miles from miami and a mere 60 miles from the capitol
00:03:23 it's pricey but it's easily accessible and it comes with the added bonus of being able to say
00:03:30 yes i have an island in the exumas then there are the more remote areas of the caribbean like little ragged island
00:03:38 a 700 acre island that's listed for 35 million dollars compared to spectabilis you get almost
00:03:43 double the land for well half the price and that's not all little ragged island has
00:03:49 two ponds meaning you have access to fresh water and it has 30 000 feet of shoreline
00:03:56 which is equal to about 5.6 miles and you'll really really have that 5.6 miles of shoreline to yourself
00:04:05 because the 110 mile long ragged island chain is incredibly underdeveloped with only one small town that has a population of 72 people
00:04:14 in other words you might as well not buy this island if you have any desire to hit up a local nightclub
00:04:20 or dine at a fancy restaurant across all these price ranges and locations the islands we've looked at all have
00:04:26 something in common they're underdeveloped at first that may not seem like a big deal
00:04:32 if you have enough money to buy a private island then surely building a house on said island
00:04:37 shouldn't be an issue right well not really because when you buy a private island you're not just paying
00:04:45 for the land to build a house on no no no there's a lot more that goes into it
00:04:50 for starters you have to find out if you even can build on the island places like the
00:04:55 caribbean have strict environmental laws on building because the ecosystem of the region
00:05:02 is so fragile there an environmental impact study is required before you make any changes
00:05:07 to the island you've bought and that environmental impact study doesn't come cheap
00:05:13 it'll cost you at least fifty thousand dollars these environmental laws are also common in canada
00:05:20 where endangered animals may call the lake and ocean islands home i mean after all you wouldn't want
00:05:26 to evict cute little critters like this would you oh look at him go in ontario specifically you're only allowed to build if there is
00:05:34 more than an acre of buildable land on the island meaning scooping up a super small island
00:05:40 for the cost of your monthly paycheck isn't actually worth it unless you feel like camping
00:05:45 on top of the expensive environmental study that takes place before you build there are dozens of environmental
00:05:51 protection laws that will increase the price of your build things like how you gather water how you
00:05:57 generate electricity and how you access the island are greatly regulated in order to protect the beautiful lakes
00:06:03 and oceans so keep in mind how much that will run the bill up in addition to the standard
00:06:08 cost of building a home but all environmental stuff aside
00:06:14 there are lots of other logistics to figure out firstly shipping building supplies to the island
00:06:20 which doesn't come cheap along with the building supplies you'll need to get heavyweight building
00:06:25 equipment on the island which requires specific boats and once you've dropped thousands and thousands of dollars to get the
00:06:32 supplies to your doorstep you need to have skilled contractors plumbers and electricians on the island daily
00:06:39 if your island is miles and miles away from the nearest town with hotels like little ragged island is in the
00:06:45 caribbean then you're looking at some massive costs just to get your building crew on site plus you have to actually build
00:06:52 a way for your preferred mode of transportation to reach the island if you want to access the island fast
00:06:59 well you can build an airstrip but most estimates put the cost of that somewhere upwards of one
00:07:05 million dollars i mean a helipad is a cheaper option or you could go with a dock for boats
00:07:09 and seaplane access but these are still going to cost you a pretty penny
00:07:15 that being said it's a lot easier to buy a developed island rather than an undeveloped one take
00:07:20 frozen k located in the berry island chain of the bahamas the 40 acre island costs
00:07:27 17 million dollars and is readily accessible by both boat and seaplane it features white
00:07:32 powder beaches lush forests and a six-bedroom six-bathroom residence
00:07:40 that measures a whopping 4145 square feet oh and there's also a heated swimming pool of course
00:07:47 in addition there is an 806 square foot manager's cottage and a 1534 foot staff cottage as well as a marina that
00:07:56 accommodates up to 100 foot long yachts however frozen k brings up yet another cost associated with
00:08:03 private islands and that's maintenance if you have enough money for a private island chances are you're pretty busy with work
00:08:11 and won't be able to spend all your time sipping pina coladas with your feet in the sand leaving the home
00:08:18 unoccupied puts you at risk of squatters break-ins and other damage so having the island occupied and taken care of
00:08:25 is a necessity though i've spent much of the video talking about the costs associated with
00:08:30 having your own private island there's also a potential to make money when you're not
00:08:35 occupying your home private island rentals are wildly popular for the wealthy including myself islands like schwanny k
00:08:44 in the bahamas have a minimum cost of 14 occupancy each additional person costs 500
00:08:54 per day so bringing just four more people will cost you sixteen thousand dollars per day at a minimum
00:09:01 not including gratuity in other words if you own that island you can make some darn good money if
00:09:05 schwanny k is rented out just as a double occupancy at the lowest rate for every day of the year
00:09:13 the property will bring in at least five million dollars there is that wonderful benefit of
00:09:18 additional income that comes with owning a private island but it'd be wrong of me not to mention
00:09:23 the other benefits which is simply owning a slice of paradise having your own escape miles
00:09:29 and miles away from the nearest person is a joy like no other waking up and walking down
00:09:33 to the beach that is yours sipping wine on the deck that is yours overlooking the ocean in your underwear
00:09:40 if you want because well it's your island you make the rules there's all sorts of reasons that people
00:09:47 dream of owning private islands that being said it's time to answer the big question is
00:09:52 owning a private island worth it well i suppose that's up to you to decide
00:09:57 are the insane costs time-consuming regulations and painstaking transportation of building supplies and amenities worth
00:10:04 lounging on an island you can call home what do you think and if you had your own private island what
00:10:09 would you name it be sure to let me know in the comments down below thanks for watching if you enjoyed the
