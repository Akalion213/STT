00:00:03 at the heart of every galaxy lies one of the most mysterious objects in the universe
00:00:13 millions to billions of times the mass of our sun these giants power astrophysical jets one of the most
00:00:19 energetic processes known in 2019 the event horizon telescope released this picture of the heart of m87
00:00:31 the first ever image of a black hole a second image released in march 2021 is helping
00:00:36 astronomers understand the inner workings of astrophysical jets and the celestial giants that fuel them
00:00:49 a quasar is a massive black hole that resides in the nucleus of most galaxies like our own and is smaller than our solar system and yet
00:00:59 through a variety of mechanisms it is able to outshine the whole galaxy around it so it is a
00:01:05 very mighty engine that's very small that is very very powerful
00:01:12 if you look at the essential features of what we currently think is going on in the tiny nuclei of these galaxies
00:01:22 is that firstly there is a black hole there which has this mass but it has one other property which i
00:01:29 believe to be very important which is that it is spinning as a black hole spins
00:01:35 it draws charged particles known as plasma into its gravitational pull these particles create a magnetic field
00:01:41 that ejects energy jets themselves comprise very hot gas and magnetic field which together
00:01:55 move with the speed that is very close to the speed of light and following the precepts of special relativity
00:02:03 that means that any radiation that they emit will be beamed along their direction of motion
00:02:11 in 1918 heber curtis discovered the first jet which he described in his notes as a
00:02:16 curious straight ray as it turned out that jet belonged to the supermassive black hole
00:02:23 in m87 so it's a rather special object in the life of an astronomer i was a research student in cambridge university
00:02:32 in the early 1970s this was in some sense a golden time for black holes my friend and colleague
00:02:37 roman snyk and i we came up with a process  which was able to extract energy from the spin of
00:02:45 a black hole with an efficiency of roughly a half and  and then we said well maybe this
00:02:51 is the power source for the jets and much else besides the blanford zanayak process describes
00:02:58 how a spinning black hole twists its magnetic fields into coils this motion creates a current of
00:03:06 electrons and positrons that flow out from the black hole in both directions accelerated by the twisting magnetic fields
00:03:14 but until the recent event horizon telescope image this process was just a theory so what we see in our image is a spiral
00:03:21 structure of the polarization which tells us that the magnetic field is also spiral
00:03:27 to have a blendford's niagara process first of all you need ordered magnetic fields which is what we see
00:03:33 our image is ordered and the spiral structure tells us that there's a component in the magnetic field
00:03:38 around the disk but there's also a vertical component which means that there is a magnetic
00:03:43 pressure that pushes out gas very close to the black hole and this is also what
00:03:49 the blend for geneaic process predicts and this vertical component we think is a direct link to how the black hole is
00:03:54 able to launch this jet it is the most energetic process or powerful process in our universe
00:04:04 these tiny nuclei smaller than the solar system but containing massive black holes
00:04:11 can produce as much energy over their lifetimes as the stars that surround them and so when we ask well how is the universe powered
00:04:21 yes there's gravity yes there are stars but these tiny but mighty galactic nuclei are big players too and so they have a
