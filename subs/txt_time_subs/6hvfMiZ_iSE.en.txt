00:00:03 today did not go to plan i had day shift today so 12 hour shift  in ed today
00:00:09 and usually what i do on these days is i set my alarm for 4 40 in the morning and i wake up
00:00:13 and i basically start lifting at 5 o'clock i live to about six 6 15 put in an hour hour and 15 minutes and
00:00:19 then i'll go to work shower and go to work and whatever prepare lunch and we'll go to work
00:00:25 this morning a bit of a mess up i didn't wake up the phone didn't wake me up so i woke up at 6 15 and all i had time
00:00:31 to do is basically you know get ready and go to work man was i pissed off
00:00:37 i have not done something like this in a very long time usually training is my number one
00:00:42 priority as soon as i open my eyes i have to get you know have to do this because who
00:00:46 knows what can happen later in the day i come home the family needs me the kids need me you know
00:00:52 something happens people are coming over and and it's very very sticky time because it's it's it's a highly
00:00:59 kind of high traffic time the pm in the afternoon  the way i've made it to 400 and
00:01:07 freaking 50 days is to basically make priority number one the first thing wake up take care of your business and
00:01:12 get on with your day so today i'll go to work without training and i was pissed off man it took me a few hours kind of
00:01:16 to wash that frustration away but  i basically made sure that when i get
00:01:23 home today you know i let my wife knowing that you know as soon as i get home i'm gonna
00:01:28 get ready and start training so that's what i did i started off with dead lifts this is the talk you
00:01:32 know after a 12 hour shift in ed standing around for most of it you know my body started my mind started
00:01:39 i really wasn't feeling like training but you gotta put in the time man you have to you know put in some sort of
00:01:46 effort towards the the your grand goal which is you know to get stronger in my case 300 deadlift 300 squat
00:01:52 so it was a hard yakka man to to to get going today my heart wasn't into it well my heart
00:01:57 was into it but my body wasn't i did five sets of 20 with deadlift 40 kilos like i usually do
00:02:03 and even then i wasn't feeling man the glutes were asleep  body was asleep cora was asleep so
00:02:10 it was it was kind of hard to get around but i pride myself on these days man i really do the harder the the
00:02:16 the odds the harder the variables at hand the more motivated i am man because you know successful people man they
00:02:24 they overcome this sort of stuff so i know that it's these days that count man it's easy
00:02:29 to train man it's easy to train when you're up and about and you want to set a pr that's easy that's effortless man
00:02:33 you just go about your business go through the motions of doing it
00:02:38 but when everything is against you and you know in the warm-up that today and end happening today is not going to be
00:02:43 an impressive day today is just basically just a nothing day you're doing it for the sake of doing it for the sake of
00:02:48 your mentality for the sake of the the spirit within you and that's what today was
00:02:55 but i feel on this stuff man i fear on it because i know if i can come in on a day like this
00:03:00 where i'm physically tired i'm mentally tired i haven't had proper food proper rest nothing's gone my way and i
00:03:05 can come in here and take care of business i know one thing and that's that my heart is in the right place man
00:03:12 and it feels good feels good in my chest to know that no matter what i'm in here paying my dues um
00:03:21 like you know it's easy man you rock up on the day when you feel good you know it's on the days when you're
00:03:26 feeling crap but anyway so rough day for me today but i got around to it  60 kilos
00:03:35 i knew here as well that today is going to be crappy and what ended up happening is because i wasn't
00:03:40 really engaged in my glutes my legs and whatever i started getting the tfl discomfort right up a hit um
00:03:50 came back again you know really on tonight i should have really warmed up a freaking hour to loosen everything up
00:03:55 but i didn't so i jumped straight into 100 kilos a few reps and i knew i knew today
00:04:02 wasn't going to be it so after i did this i i basically went to 140 and then one 60 kilo and i basically called it
00:04:07 there and  i said to my camera man there's no point going any further because all i'm really
00:04:12 going to do is just exacerbate the feeling my glutes are not working up and i'm loading it up
00:04:18 so it's silly because if the glutes are not working up you know there's other muscles jumping
00:04:23 into play and tfl is one of them tfl likes to internally rotate the hip so if the glutes are
00:04:30 really stiff the tfl has to work really really hard to internally rotate the hip because the glutes are external rotated so you
00:04:35 really need fluid hips glutes in order for the tfl to have any sort of
00:04:42 chance in balancing out the power so on the cover these days are not fun but i like i said to you man i really
00:04:55 take pride in getting after these type of days and here it is after i did that i basically did some i
00:05:00 think these are called fire hydrants i wanted to do deadlifts but it's like freaking 10 o'clock at night nine
00:05:05 o'clock at night i don't want to be banging making a lot of noise even though i'm speaking right
00:05:09 now in the garage and probably waking up the neighbors and whatever but i don't want to be making too much
00:05:14 racket with you know banging deadlifts around whatever so i just opted out to do some sort of loot
00:05:19 work and i did this anyway guys hopefully tomorrow is a better day hopefully tomorrow i
