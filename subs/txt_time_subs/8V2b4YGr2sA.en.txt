00:00:02 so this is going to be a short video a short video for a shitty session basically go hand in hand 
00:00:13 i'm sick  the fam has been sick for the last week i thought i was going to get out unscathed but
00:00:19 that's not happening chesty headache you know achy stiff like crazy when you're inflamed obviously
00:00:30 frustration plus plus plus you have one good week of training like really good week you set a pr
00:00:37 then you have a busy schedule with work you've got like four or five you know four nights
00:00:43 and then you get sick for a week so one good week and two weeks and that's basically life
00:00:53  just as when you think you're gonna kind of get ahead a little bit live life grabs you by the balls and
00:00:59 pulls you back so anyway  that's basically all for today i just basically warmed up even
00:01:06 when i'm sick some of you one of you guys actually asked me a few days ago what happens when you go when you get
00:01:10 sick well nothing man i just come in here and i get after it a little bit you know i warm up that's what i did today i
00:01:17 barely warmed up i guess obviously pushing through this is silly because you're going to prolong the recovery
00:01:24 but i do believe in not staying in bed when you're sick and moving around getting some sunlight getting some
00:01:27 oxygen into your body getting some circulation is beneficial i truly believe that
00:01:35 unless you're freaking bedridden you know from severe illness obviously you know you can't do that but all other
00:01:41 times i think even when you've got fever you can do something but then again it's all up to you and
00:01:48 you know what you think you're gonna get out of it if you think you're getting nothing out of it then don't do it obviously
00:01:54 my opinion is is that the mind is is is important and if you train your mind to get under the bar when you're feeling like
00:01:59 absolute house it's not gonna have any problem when you're not feeling is it so you're
00:02:04 kind of training for that sense  but you know people have different you know
00:02:11 perceptions on this views that's fine i still get in here and do it even though i'm frustrated and
00:02:17 i don't want to do this and like i said before it feels like house when you know you're not going to
00:02:21 do anything special you're just freaking going through the motions everything feels heavy
00:02:27 100 feels heavy i'm hitting the bar  onto the rack it's just pissed off physically pissed
00:02:34 off mentally but it is what it is man  you know there's a lot of us
00:02:40 out there who go through this obviously these moments obviously and  here's my example of how i deal with
00:02:47 mine yeah whatever you're sick but doesn't matter you know still get in here and do something so your body
00:02:53 always understands that work is going to happen every single day but anyway guys there's no point talking anymore
