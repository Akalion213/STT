00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.220
[music] let's start over again this is me hello

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.210
 in December 2020, I flew to the Hawaiian island of oahu and toured it

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.530
 up and down there is everything that your heart desires an ocean of waves and surfing volcanoes

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.289
 whales awesome hiking trails and more

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.230
 in short, so as not to repeat yourself, look at the release of this island, everything is in

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 the details of the soil sit short conclusion is bad then this is such a sample in Hawaiian

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.060
 islands but the case of Hawaii was not limited to one island here very much

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.140
 inhabited islands and I thought for a long time where they are the stunning island of kauai

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.240
 [music]

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.680
 beautiful true but unfortunately now it is completely closed for visiting there is no

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.140
 if you enter there is another interesting island not how but it will not be possible to see not

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.339
 in time to species not even after to species because this island is basically closed

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.280
 public case with them while i even show you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.059
 nothing since the video from this island is extremely difficult to find on the Internet.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.740
 the unofficial name of the forbidden island is almost impossible to get here on

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.979
 they and he do not have shops for roads, cars or telephone services

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.780
 but about 200 people live here, these are indigenous Hawaiians who almost never

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.130
 contacts with the outside world imagine this still exists today

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.950
 America it would be very interesting to look at this island unfortunately

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.289
 it is simply impossible to get in shorter, as it turned out, I had very little choice and

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:38.280
 it was of course made by [music]

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.490
 you will not believe, but in order for the sound of you to be gone, the island I had to do again

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.479
 coffee test it was the fastest most painless to the kind test ever and now

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.200
 guess how much it cost me 50 100 no 314 dollars 14 cents in the past

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.159
 times for that kind of money it was possible to fly in Turkey on the front, in general, this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.540
 was the most expensive trip in the whole history of my solo travels and I decided

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.940
 make it even more expensive [music]

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.230
 I understand that this car is probably too cool for me, but it's not so much mine

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.690
 whim how much production is necessary

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.069
 ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the big island as you probably already

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.790
 guessed from the name this is the largest island of the entire Hawaiian archipelago and

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.569
 besides, he is the youngest, we will pass all his interesting places but

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.800
 while a little rest in general rest long trips very

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.250
 an important thing especially when being away from home you don't have

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.060
 there are troubling questions such as the tap is flowing for the house for me, or

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.290
 wiring and sho there in general with an apartment, but there is one proven tool that

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.950
 will save you from such worries it is called ajax ajax

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.100
 this is a professional wireless security system that I have been doing for another year

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.730
 so one and a half ago I installed my studio here and I can tell you that this is very

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.390
 convenient and very cool thing which, in principle, me and your attitude to

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.790
 the safety of your belongings, this system can be installed anywhere

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.260
 in the office in the apartment in the house in the store and in his absence with the help of just

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.670
 one application to monitor everything at once and I will send a notification if somewhere

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.319
 burst the pipe, a fire will start or someone will try to get through the door to you

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.940
 or through the window if you install the machine is a motion sensor with a camera then

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.180
 after the alarm you will receive a series of photos to quickly assess the situation

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.590
 is it a burglar or just a cleaning lady my favorite feature is management

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.190
 sockets using the phone and they can not only be turned off remotely

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.690
 but also programming to turn on at a certain time is very cool and well,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.200
 the main acquisition for owners of a fresh repair is this leakage sensor

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.370
 elix protect you can install a ligament solenoid valve during the repair phase

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.079
 littered about that ax and in the event of a flood, at least the Hawaiians cut off the water from the mobile

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.900
 applications follow the link in the description to order a starter kit

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.250
 ajax and receive a leakage sensor whether x protect a gift and give them conceived

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 say I rented myself a room in a guest house in

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.570
 in the town of hilo on the eastern part of the island you want a joke I just appear

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.980
 settles in this half a mistress does not ask and you feel an earthquake

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.030
 I say what winter 3 he says well, like this afternoon 3 6 points

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.760
 our windows shook and this happens here on the big island quite

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.720
 often in 2017, this happened every

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.580
 day 2018, there was a strong eruption of the volcano Kilauea, one of the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.200
 the most active volcanoes on the planet until 2018, it erupted continuously for

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.710
 35 years old but now this volcano is sleeping and in it

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.250
 the crater formed a small lake so that the earthquake that occurred during the day

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.300
 was somewhat strange, but the owner of the guesthouse, Diana, assured me that it was

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.160
 complete nonsense and this happens to

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.150
 but let's not talk about alkanes for now, it's better I'll tell you about the place in which

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.050
 settled in this guest house a rather interesting party gathered my neighbor

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.620
 room to improve my health to get my dose of vitamins arrived

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.650
 here by car from Alaska. and I understand him very well in big

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.920
 sharp all year round the abundance of different fruits that grow right on your

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.150
 backyard and every day the hostess for breakfast rolled a huge plate out of

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.230
 oranges, bananas in pairs and something else I have not identified

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.960
 but it is very tasty to warn their grandmother, she says the granddaughter died in the garden

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.750
 fresh rationed narva for breakfast about the same on the big island

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.720
 the only problem with this town is the strong humidity, the wind blows here from

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.590
 the sides of the ocean are clouds and as a result, it rains almost constantly

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.400
 so the only option to see something was to leave Hilo that I

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.870
 actually made by the way rainbows on the big island probably even more than

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.390
 for Allah in winter to come to the big island is

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.620
 most of all because there are about ten climatic zones, that is, even if in

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:38.240
 one part of the island and pouring rain on the other one hundred percent street

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.810
 now a few words directly about the island

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.520
 it is formed by the top of 5 large shield volcanoes and it can be very roughly said that

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.160
 the big island is one hefty mountain sticking out of

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.199
 ocean so all the roads here go down to the water and when you go by car and

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.620
 this is of course very beautiful by the way, one more point that needs to be mentioned

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.030
 This is that in Hawaii, billboards are banned everywhere.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.910
 adds a few points to the beauty of any road you take

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.370
 you move as nothing interferes with the view when it comes to roads

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.940
 then I found a couple of cool routes here that go right through

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.080
 local jungle the feeling of driving is like driving through a greenhouse due to

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.680
 a large amount of precipitation on the western part of the island, about three of them fall

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.780
 meters a year with greenery here everything is in perfect order as well as with waterfalls but local

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.250
 the highlight is still not waterfalls, but beaches with black sand for example punalu

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.740
 beach is one of the most famous black beaches

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.220
 and not only in Hawaii, but in general in the world, he is constantly included in all sorts of ratings

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.090
 along with the big beach, which has already been seen with you in Iceland, but unlike

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.810
 Islamic beach where you can swim only in a wetsuit in Hawaiian

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.020
 swim I don’t want sand that covers everything

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.070
 from volcanic minerals and lava fragments and since it is really black this

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.130
 the beach heats up in the sun more than usual than the locals enjoy

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.630
 resident Hawaiian green turtles who are surrounded by butterflies sunbathe

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.960
 specially designated places in general in Hawaii you can swim in

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.070
 surrounded by turtles but on this beach they are so lazy that they do not swim a

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.039
 just drifting in coastal waters just like me in life

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.870
 one of the most beautiful points of the southern part of the island is perhaps the valley

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.230
 vape oh but not everything is so easy with her

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.460
 located below and to get to it you need to go down the old and very

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.660
 steep road with an average slope of 25 degrees, you can call here

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.800
 only on off-road vehicles on ordinary sedans, spu is strictly prohibited but for this

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.830
 i took a full natural jeep to go down this slope to be honest

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.660
 a little dumb at night to do in the valley as you understand, you can go down and

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.540
 on foot but this is not our method all that will happen next

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.680
 called the magic of cinema, it will seem to you that this is a completely ordinary road, but

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.390
 Believe me, she is very, very cool, both literally and figuratively before

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.050
 medium condé forces 25 degrees but in some areas

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:03.420
 it reaches as much as 45 and this very specifically fills the horizon, add here more

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.470
 the fact that the road is very narrow and you have to skip transport every now and then

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.500
 which goes up in general it was a very exciting ride

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.310
 by the way, this is the steepest road in the usa and on some sections

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.000
 she's the coolest famous baldwin street with new zealand's coolest streets in the world

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.010
 in the final section, this road to the valley drops 250 meters in height less than

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.420
 for 1 kilometer of the route, in general, you go down rather quickly, and when

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.570
 you get downstairs you understand why jack was needed here

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.769
 [music]

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:43.180
 but all this effort is definitely worth it

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.070
 here [music]

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.980
 not

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:06.150
 this is what the viper valley looks like, these rocks rise more than 600 meters and

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:11.670
 the valley is home to the highest waterfall in hawaii, sickly falls, the water falls here

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.440
 from 300 meters high, the viper valley is a sacred site in Hawaiian history and

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.790
 never home to thousands of indigenous Hawaiians who grew taro plants

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:27.140
 now about 100 people live here, but taro plantations are still in place

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.400
 [music] after Darina Viper I returned to the town

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.630
 chilo but heelas piled robust so it was decided to move to another

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.330
 part of the island is here as it is to Allah very much

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.860
 abrupt climate change, you first drive rain and then into fog and then sky

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.590
 brightens and you see the sun again and all this in less than half an hour the road that

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.280
 leads to another part of the island passes between the two highest volcanoes

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.510
 the ender is running up here a great height is very windy so we do not waste time

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.889
 and we go down for another 40 minutes and we are with you on the western

00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:04.999
 parts of a large island, the sun almost always shines here and therefore in

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:08.739
 the car suddenly appeared unnecessary parts

00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:18.799
 now this car is at least a little more like a microbe the main city is this

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:22.399
 part of the island is called kona, I made plans for it, but it turned out that

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:25.879
 almost in vain, firstly, the local landscapes can hardly be called

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:29.269
 a delight for the eyes around almost only one lava and several beaches

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:33.559
 true with real white sand, which is rare on the island, however, a few

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:38.809
 interesting things I still found here the first coffee in my life I couldn't porridge

00:11:38.809 --> 00:11:43.129
 to think that in America they make coffee because it's America, then everything turns out to be

00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:48.019
 they still do yes, this is such a surprise leg life grows coffee and all because of a very

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:51.799
 interesting combination of climate here and a hefty mountain on the horizon is a volcano

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:55.479
 its name in Hawaiian sounds like a line from a song by the band Lyapis Trubetskoy

00:11:55.479 --> 00:11:58.789
 wa la lai here it is very clear that on

00:11:58.789 --> 00:12:02.899
 coast con and great weather and sunny and it rains on the mountain that is

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:06.979
 the climate on the slope of the volcano is more humid and these are good conditions for growing coffee

00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:10.669
 which is what the locals use to grow one hundred percent Hawaiian coffee

00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:14.059
 the second interesting story is directly related to the city of kona

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:18.049
 the fact is that every year probably the most famous championship is held here in

00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:22.579
 the world of triathlon called ironman iron man then perhaps not

00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:26.419
 knowing this size it is a race that includes almost 4 kilometers of swimming

00:12:26.419 --> 00:12:30.739
 one hundred and eight kilometers on a bike and a marathon distance in running and important

00:12:30.739 --> 00:12:34.159
 say that all these disciplines go one after another, that is, all this happens in

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:36.379
 one day the ironman is considered one of the most

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:40.850
 difficult one-day competitions in and around the world has long been formed

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.089
 a certain kui if suddenly you have friends a triathlete does not just have a friend

00:12:44.089 --> 00:12:48.319
 which runs the ironman blank otherwise you should know that it is completely shifted

00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:50.570
 in fact, people, that is, there is even such

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.410
 saying that a triathlete at home says this to a family but in a good way in general

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:59.120
 when there is a district all the streets are packed with people because

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.510
 a huge amount of support comes and is absolutely amazing

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:07.250
 energy I have not only heard, I have never seen it and this year how

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.270
 you understand the exchange that takes place here in October was also canceled

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:16.430
 due to the coronavirus epidemic, unfortunately, this is where my story about horses ends

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.240
 look turned out to be practically nothing, so we move on to your

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.880
 the island, as well as on wah, I had several interesting

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.720
 very unexpected meetings with my acquaintances, and by the way, it seemed to me

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.140
 here I have a bank of springs in my hands, so I decided to introduce a new heading

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.980
 she is called an acquaintance who stepped in hawaii, we do not know how

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.510
 quite by accident a scanner or with a friend of mine growing up for installation in Kiev and he

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.690
 straight noble traveler traveled more countries even than I traveled rostik

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.260
 that 13 countries and he is a great example of how you can travel from not very

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.580
 big budget and travel is always very budget as far as I understand and

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.130
 I can put under the bridge, but I also have such a format on and

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:59.810
 usually there three days hardcore one glamor three days you go with a tent somewhere sleeping

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.870
 it is not clear where then for a day or two you are resting in some hotel

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.920
 ler bingley decently that is, it's not even a question of money, absolutely this is the format

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.480
 knowledge of the place, that is, you yourself do not understand that one thing is a page in a hotel

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.380
 it's another matter to become on couchsurfing to immediately understand the culture from the inside, that is

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:21.480
 my principle of travel is to stop being a tourist just from the ladder

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.260
 the plane in the new place is very cool, so we take this quote on

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.980
 arms growth invited me to a rather unusual place this

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.760
 a kind of cross between a Balinese retreat and a community of enlightened people who

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.630
 live here doing yoga spiritual practices or are not on

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.050
 self-sufficiency as you understand most of the vegetarians here, so with

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.380
 nutritional problems do not arise especially besides here it is really very

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.779
 beautifully right on the territory you can feed the peacocks lizards and get

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:51.390
 luli from geese who are here as a security service

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:56.010
 one of the residents of this community, Igor, showed us his home and you only

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:12.540
 look at this house in the jungle in all this he made with his own hands and in

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.510
 the house was found a large number of musical instruments including even

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.140
 Slavic a little later it turned out that almost everyone I met in this retreat

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.670
 speak Russian and in general Andy ran over a rather large Russian-speaking community

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.880
 to understand the reasons for all this, I asked for a visit to the bathtub which

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.810
 lives near con and he built a big house here and his family is also not

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.100
 little wife and five children please tell me

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.440
 I'm just 10 why there is such a large Russian-speaking community here

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:47.450
 running for I think this is what is cheaper here the rent was cheaper and the house in general

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:53.420
 buy it was possible to keep a member wahu or small well how

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.590
 there is land here you can here some proof of the phone to an expensive place

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:03.410
 Kaunas in having a small town and a shtamba is more expensive on average somewhere around 300 thousand

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:09.410
 plot of land plot of land thousand here is our plot 1 a car mod we bought for 300

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.630
 that on the south on the common vetom city an acre of land is the same as mine will cost

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:20.000
 15 thousand seriously, but the prices went up and it was possible to buy for 5000 why

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.680
 so cheap because there is nothing there just a piece of wowa basis

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:30.440
 another of the big reasons why it's not cheap there is lava zoom they have

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:36.100
 it is considered highways lava zones remember this term in the future it will come in handy

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:41.660
 if again a volcano then they can flood most of all, then they do not give it more interesting

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:48.670
 at home many banks do not give loans.She is at home because highways

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.620
 but the next day I went to see the area I was talking about

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:58.360
 ivan this is how the settlement looks like india on a big island here really

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.240
 ocean view but the good news ends there

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.740
 before the ointment builds directly on the lava that once went down the slopes of the volcano

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.000
 mauna loa and despite the potential danger they continue to build here

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.010
 the hope that the eruption will no longer be as long as the area is lucky but lucky

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.690
 on the big island, unfortunately, not everyone, to show this I came to

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:24.310
 the area called Leilani states visually it seems that this is the most

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:30.240
 usual area but it is not quite usual and now you will understand why

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.200
 this once beautiful village now in places resembles the underworld many

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.049
 roads or dead ends pass further

00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:47.000
 forbidden from afar it seems that some hills begin there but this is not

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.039
 all the hills are craters and volcanic cracks that have formed here in

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:57.289
 as a result of the eruption of volcano Kilauea in 2018, all these waste heaps grew

00:17:57.289 --> 00:18:01.340
 right in the middle of the streets of Laylani estates huge swathes of the area

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.279
 were flooded with lava despite the fact that enough had passed

00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:08.929
 a lot of time underground here it is still hot and the park that currency is met

00:18:08.929 --> 00:18:14.000
 a vivid reminder of this and now the most interesting in lilani states is still

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.360
 people live and plots are still sold here

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.559
 to understand what it is like to live in ailani pinworms, imagine what you have in the back

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.600
 the courtyard next to the pool has its own small

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.870
 a volcano that can erupt at any time

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:33.919
 this is how people live here we get it now when we are here I want you

00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:37.429
 we looked at the footage that was filmed there are two slopes of the year ago

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:43.130
 This footage was shot by Brian Lauri from a helicopter at the end of May 2018 at

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.000
 the territory of the settlement of Lilani and the states formed two dozen volcanic

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.830
 cracks that were filled with lava all around the most famous crack number eight

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.580
 which was located on luana street produced a huge fountain of lava

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.929
 hitting 100 meters up this molten mass descended down to

00:18:59.929 --> 00:19:03.250
 moving the ocean at an average speed of 74 meters

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:08.130
 for an hour she burned the roads, trees there, but in general, everything that came across on the way

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:13.230
 peak moments this area suffered about 400 earthquakes in 24 hours

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.220
 most of Taiwan's states were wiped out

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.190
 200 houses but fortunately no one died

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.040
 during my trip to the big island, I met with Alexey Lyosha

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.230
 one of those who lost their home here is the road he used to drive every day

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:39.200
 now it ends in long black moscow

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:46.109
 [music]

00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:50.440
 this belief

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.770
 [music]

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:03.090
 Lyosha's family for the first time in a long time came to see the place where

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.740
 once stood their house

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.160
 [music]

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.490
 it is almost impossible to determine its exact location now everything

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:24.880
 covered with a thick layer of solidified lava we have not climbed there yet we bought land and we

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:32.110
 did not know that this is chapter 1 chapter 2 head of zones van in english i am so head of zone 1

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:38.740
 this means that under the ground, lava always flows directly into the ocean, we did not know this

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.830
 what does it mean in the flowerpot 1st why here

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:46.570
 the plot was cheaper than other places because such nature is so beautiful

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:52.690
 and as cheaply as not to buy and then it would be when

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.740
 Zhilova flowed, we understood what amazon is one, it means any moment

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:04.930
 can you go to the land and take everything, well, I think it was worth the risk we are not we are not

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:11.140
 we regret nothing that we bought it here how long we lived here we bought in

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.840
 in the fourteenth year of the eighteenth the volcano took all

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.960
 if you forget about these black melts for a second, then the place is really

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:26.700
 very beautiful to the ocean just 7 minutes by car children also liked hot

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:35.309
 the sources were of a range so I think it was worth it we we were building

00:21:35.309 --> 00:21:42.539
 and we had a very large living room kitchen strap toilet and a large awning

00:21:42.539 --> 00:21:51.710
 we were also built on bought material, the purpose of the loop was in debt, we left at that time

00:21:51.710 --> 00:22:01.559
 when we were in the con, we had a universelle woman with a sphere, the graph needed them

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:05.669
 and when we went there to rest and on the news we saw that there are words

00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:13.020
 started and when we realized that we could pick up some things and we

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:20.580
 when they returned to lowered another couple to pick up things and then to one of the

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:28.919
 these times, the police just water but all these services drove us out of there

00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:34.260
 because the crack began on the road and the cracks began to grow more and more they

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:39.919
 good glass in another place, but not yet flowed around us, and when to put these things but

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:44.880
 cracks grow, they evacuated us, they did not allow us to return anything

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.100
 pick up and did not see any more merit and did not see it again on the 17th, we found out

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:56.669
 that the house was already covered, it was hard for my wife to tell because she was

00:22:56.669 --> 00:23:00.809
 still had some hope that it would still remain

00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:05.379
 it is worth adding that Lyosha Vera bought a new house, although he is also in

00:23:05.379 --> 00:23:11.440
 the zone of potential damage of the volcano Kilauea of ​​this vazon 3 is not a word zone

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:19.090
 1 that is, the new amazon magazine has all the lava zones here, it's just that it's less sickly here

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:27.210
 this city is all lava zones 3 so we are kind of exposed but not as before

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.419
 Lyosha test me on the beach, I did not like to spend time with the whole family

00:23:34.419 --> 00:23:41.230
 but now it bears little resemblance to the beach that was here before May 2018 in order to

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.490
 it was clearer how this place looked before the eruption, just look at Google

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.419
 the map has not been updated and it is very clear there that there was a real beach

00:23:49.419 --> 00:24:04.179
 there was a special place for launching the boat and now, due to the eruption

00:24:04.179 --> 00:24:08.799
 Kilauea volcano 2018, the landscape of the island has changed forever

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:12.789
 for this reason, it is easy to calculate the exact area began in da

00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:17.649
 impossible because she is constantly changing for the same reason says this

00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:21.730
 the only US state whose territory is slowly but surely increasing

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.929
 and all because of the eruptions that were and are likely to occur in

00:24:25.929 --> 00:24:28.850
 near future barge on the big island active

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.960
 volcanoes here will continue to appear such black rocks black

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.510
 the beach that a person will try somehow

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.740
 adapt for yourself, but it turned out that my story with alkanes on a large

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:45.380
 the island on this did not end the next morning on December 21, 2020 I

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.530
 I just lie in bed, open a news site and see it

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.310
 [applause] I was located yesterday at 10 pm Lent

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:05.020
 very tired but 10-30 there was an earthquake of 4 points and right now there started

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:09.400
 erupting a volcano for locals is probably usually the case, but I'm just shocked

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.740
 I am suppliers that did not manage to be here at this very moment shorter than a leg in

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:25.810
 hands have to go along the path and saw this huge cloud that was visible

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:31.330
 the state of many kilometers means the next story is this volcano it

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:35.020
 called kilauea it's a local celebrity because here

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:39.820
 did business before this but in 2017 he did not show any signs of activity

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.150
 that is, I was going to tell the real one that I had arrived and, as it were, no

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:58.420
 activity did not live in some kind of lava it is impossible to remove and here I am on you for now

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.900
 I don’t understand if I can get to the national park, they will come to us sooner too

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.270
 in all, it should not be closed to visitors

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.450
 but how less should all be seen by their own

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:12.840
 eyes in general, the story develops live on both Yandex and

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.210
 to my surprise, the volcano park was not closed, I met several

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.990
 rangers but got inside without any problems and was among the first to come here

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.840
 morning [music]

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.930
 clouds of volcanic gas were hanging over the parking lot and this is what I saw

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:38.380
 from the observation deck at the crater rear [music]

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.000
 hello this is your predator from plant and on top dushkin straight from the scene I'm like

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.420
 that I missed everything because everything happened at night here inside the crater

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.010
 there was water that mixed with glory, it turned out to be an explosion like this all this

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.100
 looks like

00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:59.629
 on my arrival at the site already worked TV crew of a well-known channel

00:26:59.629 --> 00:27:03.619
 here I met Brian Lauri as a professional volcanic photographer

00:27:03.619 --> 00:27:08.389
 who photographed all the eruptions of volcano Kilauea since 91 Brian

00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:12.019
 logit site lava peak where you can see photos of battles on

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:16.210
 the big island and there are more than a thousand

00:27:36.879 --> 00:27:58.789
 expects deduction of the element to the floor muzzle from the crater of the volcano Kilauea

00:27:58.789 --> 00:28:03.979
 huge about a kilometer in diameter and the encoder is even larger in some places

00:28:03.979 --> 00:28:07.969
 it reaches a width of 2 and a half miles, which is about four kilometers all

00:28:07.969 --> 00:28:11.419
 this is the result and the many images that continuously occurred here in

00:28:11.419 --> 00:28:16.129
 in recent years, Kilauea is a shield volcano; visually, it is very different from

00:28:16.129 --> 00:28:19.969
 volcano in a conical shape, which we are used to seeing as the famous

00:28:19.969 --> 00:28:24.700
 volcanoes and guatemala [music]

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.910
 flag is capable of erupting several times a day, throwing out lava and

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.480
 volcanic bombs shield volcanoes can't show this

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.740
 show, but they have their own advantages, for example, you can look into the crater

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.990
 volcano this is how the crater of Kilauea looked a few days after the eruption

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:47.000
 the huge black mass below is a lava lake more than 100 meters deep.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.790
 fills and will continue to fill with lava from

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:54.650
 two volcanic cracks in the crater in February 2021, the depth of this lake

00:28:54.650 --> 00:29:00.160
 has already reached 216 meters and it will continue to grow

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.500
 in short, what is happening now is a great success, everyone tells me that I am

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.330
 damn lucky but in general I actually came to this national park by

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:12.470
 for one big reason, because his example can be used to explain how in general

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.250
 appeared speak and now if you do not mind

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.040
 a little bit of dialogue and a big stop where we are now

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.270
 the volcanic island is the second largest in the world only Iceland is larger than it

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.570
 over there in the corner of priceline I once told a big issue if that

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.710
 look so volcanic islands appear thanks to the volcano oni sochi

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:34.490
 appears where there are some sulfur pride on this map, these joints are highlighted

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.610
 in dark blue, just along this border pass the so-called

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:42.650
 pacific ring of fire is 328 out of 500 40 of all active

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:46.940
 There are many volcanoes on earth and they are far from this zone.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.840
 in the center of the lithospheric plates, how did they appear, the fact is that

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.260
 in the center of the Pacific lithospheric plate is the so-called Hawaiian

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.460
 hot. if very roughly then this is a huge mass of magma that rises

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.970
 to the surface of the earth, it is a high temperature furnace and smelted

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:05.360
 Hawaiian islands and the principle of operation is similar to this night light, which is popularly

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.750
 called a lava lamp, incandescent magma rises from the core

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:14.090
 surface lithospheric plates burning tandoor and creates volcanoes here

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.690
 hot. here is the pacific lithospheric plates

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:21.529
 hot. does not move anywhere on stands still the plate moves and with the help of this

00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:24.289
 hotspot on this plate is formed by islands

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:27.919
 if you look at the map, you can see the trajectory along which the Hawaiian

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:31.610
 hotspot burned hawaii on the lithospheric plate of the island located

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.990
 one after another kind of chain and the last as the youngest is a big island

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:40.279
 the process of its formation is happening right now in front of our eyes there

00:30:40.279 --> 00:30:43.820
 In the crater of Kilauea volcano, building materials rise to the surface of the earth

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.169
 which will increase the area of ​​the island therefore volcanoes, although they cause

00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:53.299
 evil to man, but at the same time they do great geological deeds, but let's return to

00:30:53.299 --> 00:30:56.659
 the first site is a lot of tourists now, in fact, there is nothing yet

00:30:56.659 --> 00:31:00.759
 happens, I think that the right decision would be to come here in the evening and

00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:06.049
 So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Sunset Evening Kilauea Show here at

00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:10.549
 How many times are extra low than during the day and the lake illuminates the smoke from the crater and from the side

00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:13.389
 it seems that this is such a gateway to the underworld

00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:17.259
 in the evening of the lookout, hundreds of tourists gathered and everyone naturally needs

00:31:17.259 --> 00:31:21.279
 there was a photo with a bow even though you seem to be on

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:26.589
 a safe distance and this thing is, well, far away, but it all looks like at night

00:31:26.589 --> 00:31:30.609
 straight as sinister as possible I can only imagine that

00:31:30.609 --> 00:31:35.109
 saw the people who came here first after the eruption here it was straight

00:31:35.109 --> 00:31:41.979
 real devilish fishing, I decided to make a little hack what to see

00:31:41.979 --> 00:31:46.539
 another point because there is not enough parking for everyone, but our quality

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:50.259
 Americans are the ultimate handsome men, everything is beautifully sorted out here

00:31:50.259 --> 00:31:54.820
 parking attendants found parking spaces in general by professionals but most importantly

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.549
 hayko time is heaven in principle and light is not needed

00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:01.839
 because his king from the volcano illuminates non-being, the principle can be seen where

00:32:01.839 --> 00:32:04.049
 these

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:09.070
 while padga you will be a hot spot that feeds the volcano and they will

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:12.669
 continue to grow but over time the Pacific plate that moves

00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:17.950
 move these islands farther from the hearth and they begin to cool down and collapse and how

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.039
 consequence to dive into the ocean under its own weight and we have

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:25.210
 about 10 million years to see them because after that

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:30.899
 period here in this place most likely there will be no islands

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.340
 but 10 million years is not such a short time, so I hope that all

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:41.380
 did so for this whole story as a large island but one final

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.380
 chord sun set of a beautiful place naturally with a place I have long been

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.520
 the actual part was determined for the sake of this place and I flew to the big one for everything

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.630
 for this we need warm clothes, an all-wheel drive car and as much as possible

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.580
 more oxygen drove

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:02.680
 it's time to tell where we are going our goal is this peak

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.990
 on the horizon it is not only the highest peak

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.350
 Hawaiian islands but also the highest mountain on our planet

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:12.550
 if you count the height from the ocean floor, it is called mauna-kea

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:19.000
 and as you might have guessed, this is also the shield volcano mauna-kea is not

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.110
 only the highest mountain on the harbor but the place you are there is probably the most

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.000
 world famous astronomical observatory

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.330
 it is located at an altitude of more than four kilometers above sea level

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:32.470
 therefore, in order to get there, it is imperative to make the installation shorter than this

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.620
 the mountain is so high that in order to go there to the top

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.850
 it is necessary to acclimatize here at an altitude of 2800 meters and this process

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:44.770
 will be done by everyone who goes up there, even scientists who work on mauna-kea for

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:48.700
 acclimatization here for good you need to spend at least an hour I neglected

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:54.040
 to check these standards here for 10 minutes for which subsequently the network paid for

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.280
 in fact, everything is serious enough since at the top there is an observatory on

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.580
 the entrance is a ranger who asks you where are you from to record all your

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.180
 contact details because the number of places on the top is limited therefore

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:08.170
 in fact, I was so early and arrived one more nuance to the top of the start only on

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.530
 four-wheel drive cars, but this question was decided at the very beginning of his

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:16.680
 travel and now about the important and the roads to mauna kea

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:27.730
 [music]

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:33.940
 this road is just dastish fantastish mauna kea so high that the clouds and

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.560
 your problems remain somewhere down there and you see with the feeling that you are conquering

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.969
 some kind of new peak for myself damn, I cannot convey in words how beautiful it is

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:51.110
 [music]

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:58.500
 [music] not bad, I'll say so in a couple of hours

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.010
 climb to 4200 meters almost from sea level

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.390
 unit nuance is that there was hilo plus 27

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:09.539
 and here on mauna-kea + 6 so let's get warm

00:35:09.539 --> 00:35:19.710
 and let's see what's what's here, so we are on mauna-kea here

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:22.740
 the observatory of the same name which has a total of 13

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:27.690
 telescopes belonging to 11 different countries to create very briefly why

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:32.369
 the disk you built right here, well, first of all, on mauna kea, it is always practically

00:35:32.369 --> 00:35:36.539
 the weather is always good we will repent by learning the altitude and the clouds are usually lower

00:35:36.539 --> 00:35:40.769
 us secondly, there is a very clean atmosphere, that is, remoteness

00:35:40.769 --> 00:35:45.660
 civilization the air is very clean 3 there is no light pollution I am in this

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.460
 will tell you lived in australia 2 4 here very low humidity and very good so

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.960
 called 100 magical vision here they say turbulence is shorter if briefly

00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.269
 this is almost an ideal place for observing the starry sky in general in

00:36:00.269 --> 00:36:06.089
 the world, and besides ideal conditions for astronomy, it is also

00:36:06.089 --> 00:36:11.220
 and a very beautiful place as it is the highest mountain in Hawaii and the mountains as

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:15.839
 usually this is a sacred place for locals, then the locals are naturally very

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:20.009
 they rebel strongly that there is some kind of construction going on here, especially after

00:36:20.009 --> 00:36:23.670
 of how they decided to build here on mauna kea

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:27.869
 kente telescope 30-meter telescope in the world's largest

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:33.619
 in general, the wild catavasia began, the Hawaiians stood up to protect the mountain

00:36:33.619 --> 00:36:38.359
 sort out the campground walked with banners for not even fit

00:36:38.359 --> 00:36:43.039
 Jason Momoa who hails from here gets beaten in general while this is

00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:45.410
 the telescope was suspended, I do not know what it has to do only with the offensive

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:48.829
 local residents, either from the fact that money is needed for it

00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:52.069
 very, very much as for the maintenance of other telescopes

00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:56.299
 these high-tech machines with mirror diameters from 1 to 25 meters

00:36:56.299 --> 00:37:00.589
 requires constant cooling to very low temperatures and operation 1

00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:04.910
 a telescope a year can cost tens of millions of dollars telescopes for

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:09.230
 mauna kea looks extremely futuristic and there are even celebrities among them

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:14.029
 for example telescopes keck yes that's the real name so astronomers too

00:37:14.029 --> 00:37:18.109
 It turns out that key card telescopes have long been considered the largest in

00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:22.460
 the world, but then they were outstripped by a large telescope in the Canary Islands.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.809
 Konstantin Batygin works in one of these observatories who you may know

00:37:26.809 --> 00:37:31.640
 from the issue here I'm talking about Konstantin Batygin and, in fact, this person is one of

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.900
 co-authors of theories about the 9th planet Kostya works on

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.200
 Japanese telescope subaru but during filming he was at home

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.089
 at home, so we talked via video link, these few everyday issues I spent

00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:47.630
 on the mountain and about two o'clock and I was forced to go down because I

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:51.710
 physically it was very difficult to be like you are the people that I ask you to spend there

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:55.130
 well a lot of time how do you deal with miners

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:59.960
 and is it possible for me to cope and accustomed to all this means the next process we

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:05.740
 first we climb 10,000 feet from where we went in fact and where is this center

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:14.900
 for visors you have to sleep there and only after 48 hours can we go we can

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:21.400
 in fact, I always have a problem with driving around the third hour

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:29.030
 for 1 first night it's not yes they just kind of stay tired local

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:33.830
 we give up, that is, when trivial things that need to be done on a telescope like

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:39.710
 press the up button twice then press enter i forget how many times

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:46.430
 pressed and I just completely shut off the brain then the first couple of nights this

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:50.030
 on oxygen but then get used to just say

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.450
 here the clock is just basic for people who do not understand at all, including

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:58.580
 me, what discoveries were made with the help of the telescope located on

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:03.440
 milk, in principle, there are a lot of them, for example

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:11.750
 Belev prize this year was given to a group of people who worked on

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:17.150
 andj gates galaxy center bills professor she used just like

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:23.060
 when as soon as he was still then completely Polish from the young and she used

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:28.910
 to prove that there is a super massive black hole at the center of the galaxy

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.210
 while building and maintaining these telescopes costs billions

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.970
 dollars and they may never pay off

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:42.210
 they will pay off what to call they will pay off in something that is difficult

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:49.450
 to convert currency to look for a job I will get it because we

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:55.450
 there they found something, any of this is precisely from the category of us knowledge that

00:39:55.450 --> 00:40:03.550
 very, very really important and they really like said even they are out of shape I forget

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:12.060
 as the chunks said but they are useful they are useful and at the same time they are absolutely useless

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:17.230
 the results of investments that were buried here in 11 countries, we are unlikely to be able to

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:21.850
 touch but perhaps knowledge is obtained and in these observatories there was once a way of life

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:27.160
 to our descendants, so this is a long-term investment of oxygen kapets as not

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:32.650
 it's very difficult for me to speak, but to be honest, I just excited you because

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:37.870
 that I dreamed of getting to this place for ten years since I watched films

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:43.600
 about astrophysics and about the Kek observatory in general, now what will happen is what I do

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.600
 waited a long time for the sun set on mauna kea and then did not take pictures and the starry sky

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.969
 [music]

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:31.429
 [music]

00:41:33.329 --> 00:41:37.529
 a man going down is rising I'm wildly cold and spinning very much

00:41:37.529 --> 00:41:42.390
 head due to altitude sickness but they also do not give

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:47.160
 here for tourists to stay after sunset because in America if this headlight is in

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.269
 general light pollution, but in fact, below from under and we

00:41:51.269 --> 00:41:56.069
 of course now we will stop there and see what the starry sky looks like above

00:41:56.069 --> 00:42:00.029
 mauna kea forgive me for this slurred speech without oxygen was well, right at all

00:42:00.029 --> 00:42:04.109
 bad, but as soon as I went downstairs, the camera became much easier.

00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:09.959
 set it remains now only to wait in the case of astrophotography find out usually

00:42:09.959 --> 00:42:14.759
 it takes long enough to make these short videos I had to

00:42:14.759 --> 00:42:17.759
 wait about two hours but the results were

00:42:17.759 --> 00:42:21.359
 far from ideal in the first place, not everything was good in terms of shooting conditions, but during

00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:26.009
 second, as Kostya said on the mountain, I was a little dull, but something interesting

00:42:26.009 --> 00:42:31.660
 I still managed to capture a look at the lower left corner you will find out

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:35.799
 This is our old friend, the volcano Kilauea, illuminates the clouds with its crater

00:42:35.799 --> 00:42:40.240
 which reflect the bright light of lava the idea with astrophotography was actually here

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.349
 failed a little because firstly, the moon shines brightly in the sky, and secondly

00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:48.670
 the car is constantly driving there is light and the air temperature, to be honest, is up to 34

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:54.640
 degrees so not super comfortable so let's see how it looks

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.130
 peak fullness at night

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.670
 such a starry sky above the summit that night and unfortunately did not see it, but here

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:10.230
 sunset on mauna kea was definitely shortlisted for the most memorable of all

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:15.480
 time before I have my final say on Hawaii very

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.270
 short ad i finally got my own

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:23.970
 merchandise if you want to know what it means and where to buy it all see the link in

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:28.260
 description and now what really is everything here will be very simple, I think that

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.170
 you saw everything yourself and of course if there is an opportunity at least once in your life

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:35.760
 fly to hawaii this is one hundred percent you need to do here there is a lot

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:40.560
 unique things but I actually travel the islands with a different thought about

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.730
 it may seem very seditious modern varnish of this period, but I

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:50.609
 nevertheless, I voiced a very thought that it’s how easy it was to travel, the meaning is

00:43:50.609 --> 00:43:55.290
 that when I was preparing for the release I read the history of the Hawaiian Islands in general people

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.740
 still there a hundred years ago, maybe even a little more there were already travelers currency

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.250
 what to get to Hawaii will need to be carried out on a ship

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:08.040
 on the ship for several months people could not know there get infected die along the way

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:13.890
 well, in general, it was wildly difficult now even in such a remote place as hawaii

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:18.869
 really the other end of the world, well, a day and a half, maybe you can fly and

00:44:18.869 --> 00:44:23.339
 in a day to actually manage and it's just like that compared to the fact that

00:44:23.339 --> 00:44:26.940
 it was a hundred years ago and now the traveler has everything a hotel

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:31.260
 there is a gps navigator no maps are needed in general, again I will say again now this

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.849
 contradictory phrase we just get it right never before traveling

00:44:35.849 --> 00:44:40.920
 it was not as easy as in our time, even despite the coronavirus and naturally

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:45.690
 having such opportunities, it is advisable not to use in general travel

00:44:45.690 --> 00:45:29.460
 she still stands [music]
