 serve this human right, but Putin flies to Kemerovo to the people after a direct

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.010
 there is no line in order for people to be imprisoned there in Kemerovo before his arrival so that these

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.220
 people did not rush out to Putin for any meeting with these meetings

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.770

 will transfer this to Roskomnadzor with the requirement to delete the information site

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.210
 will have to delete it otherwise they may block the page I wonder if

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.580
 this is a deliberately false denunciation, an attempt to slap the hands of journalists.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.069
 this law does not contradict another law we already have in the criminal code

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:42.849
 obstacles to work journalist how easy it is to take paper to the circus nonsense and risk

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:46.539
