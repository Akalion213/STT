00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of genetics
 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of genetics
is<00:05:29.199><c> for</c><00:05:29.360><c> them</c><00:05:29.520><c> to</c><00:05:29.680><c> stay</c><00:05:30.000><c> constant</c><00:05:30.479><c> and</c><00:05:30.560><c> for</c>

is for them to stay constant and for

is for them to stay constant and for

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
mutations to be rare
 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.950 align:start position:0%
mutations to be rare
yes<00:05:33.039><c> yet</c><00:05:33.280><c> in</c><00:05:33.360><c> your</c><00:05:33.600><c> experiment</c><00:05:34.080><c> it</c><00:05:34.240><c> seems</c>

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
yes yet in your experiment it seems
 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.310 align:start position:0%
yes yet in your experiment it seems
they're<00:05:35.360><c> not</c><00:05:35.680><c> rare</c>

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
they're not rare
 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.310 align:start position:0%
they're not rare
so<00:05:36.560><c> we</c><00:05:36.720><c> estimate</c><00:05:37.680><c> that</c><00:05:37.919><c> in</c><00:05:38.080><c> our</c><00:05:38.960><c> bacteria</c>

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
so we estimate that in our bacteria
 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.110 align:start position:0%
so we estimate that in our bacteria
only<00:05:40.720><c> about</c><00:05:41.360><c> one</c><00:05:41.680><c> out</c><00:05:41.919><c> of</c><00:05:42.160><c> maybe</c><00:05:42.479><c> a</c><00:05:42.560><c> hundred</c><00:05:42.960><c> or</c>

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
only about one out of maybe a hundred or
 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.230 align:start position:0%
only about one out of maybe a hundred or
one<00:05:43.360><c> out</c><00:05:43.440><c> of</c><00:05:43.600><c> a</c><00:05:43.680><c> thousand</c>

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
one out of a thousand
 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.790 align:start position:0%
one out of a thousand
cells<00:05:45.039><c> will</c><00:05:45.199><c> have</c><00:05:45.440><c> even</c><00:05:45.680><c> a</c><00:05:45.759><c> single</c><00:05:46.080><c> mutation</c>

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
cells will have even a single mutation
 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.830 align:start position:0%
cells will have even a single mutation
so

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.469 align:start position:0%
so
that's<00:05:48.080><c> not</c><00:05:48.320><c> very</c><00:05:48.560><c> much</c><00:05:49.039><c> by</c><00:05:49.280><c> contrast</c><00:05:50.240><c> in</c>

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
that's not very much by contrast in
 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.230 align:start position:0%
that's not very much by contrast in
humans<00:05:50.880><c> it's</c><00:05:51.120><c> estimated</c><00:05:51.600><c> that</c><00:05:51.840><c> each</c><00:05:52.000><c> one</c><00:05:52.160><c> of</c>

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
humans it's estimated that each one of
 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.310 align:start position:0%
humans it's estimated that each one of

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
our offspring has perhaps
 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.909 align:start position:0%
our offspring has perhaps

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
10 20 50 new mutations so the bacteria
 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.350 align:start position:0%
10 20 50 new mutations so the bacteria
are<00:05:58.000><c> extremely</c><00:05:58.479><c> conservative</c><00:05:59.039><c> but</c><00:05:59.199><c> there</c><00:05:59.280><c> are</c>

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
are extremely conservative but there are
 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.790 align:start position:0%
are extremely conservative but there are

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
also billions of them
 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
also billions of them
in<00:06:01.039><c> even</c><00:06:01.280><c> a</c><00:06:01.440><c> tiny</c><00:06:01.840><c> flask</c><00:06:02.720><c> and</c><00:06:02.880><c> so</c><00:06:03.039><c> if</c><00:06:03.199><c> you</c><00:06:03.280><c> have</c>

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.350 align:start position:0%
in even a tiny flask and so if you have
a<00:06:03.600><c> chance</c><00:06:03.919><c> in</c><00:06:04.080><c> a</c><00:06:04.160><c> thousand</c><00:06:04.560><c> of</c><00:06:04.720><c> mutating</c><00:06:05.280><c> and</c>

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
a chance in a thousand of mutating and
 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.110 align:start position:0%
a chance in a thousand of mutating and
you<00:06:05.440><c> have</c><00:06:05.600><c> a</c><00:06:05.759><c> billion</c><00:06:06.160><c> individuals</c>

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
you have a billion individuals
 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.830 align:start position:0%
you have a billion individuals
then<00:06:07.680><c> every</c><00:06:08.240><c> day</c><00:06:08.639><c> in</c><00:06:08.720><c> one</c><00:06:08.880><c> of</c><00:06:08.960><c> these</c><00:06:09.199><c> flasks</c><00:06:09.680><c> we</c>

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
then every day in one of these flasks we
 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.189 align:start position:0%
then every day in one of these flasks we

might have a million
